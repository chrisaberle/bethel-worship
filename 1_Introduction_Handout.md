# 1: Introduction Handout

## Summary

> By the grace of God, Bethel exists as a church for Lake Charles and its surrounding communities where God’s worship and Word defines us, His Spirit changes us, and the Gospel of Jesus compels us.

We're starting in on a series that unpacks some key sections of Bethel's mission statement. The first thing we'll be covering is **"God's worship ... defines us."**

This week, we introduce the concept of **worship** broadly. We talk a bit about why we come to church on Sunday, and why we do the things we do while we're there.

## Term Overview

The term will be split into three broad chunks:

1. A Biblical Theology of worship
2. A Systematic Theology of worship
3. Practical and historical applications of these theologies

**Biblical Theology** attempts to tell the story of the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus. **Systematic theology** attempts to summarize all the Bible has to say about a certain topic. These two taken together inform how we **apply** the Bible's teaching to our own circumstances.

## Why are we here?

1. Sunday Worship is for **evangelism**.

<br>
<br>

2. Sunday Worship is for the **education** of the church.

<br>
<br>

3. Sunday Worship is meant to **encourage** and build up the church.

<br>
<br>

4. Sunday Worship is for the praise and **exaltation** of God.

##  Definitions

**Hebrew**: _cagad, shachah;_ To prostrate oneself, to prostrate in homage. 

**Greek:** _proskuneo;_ To prostrate oneself. One of the more common words for worship in the NT, and the word used in the key passage of the woman at the well ([John 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+4&version=NASB)). _eusebeo;_ To honor or worship. Used by Paul at Mars Hill ([Acts 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+17&version=NASB)). _latreuo_; To serve or worship, used in [Romans 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12&version=NASB).

In the Bible, the word "worship" typically has a very narrow, physical sense. It is the literal act of bowing down to something. The Greek expands on this idea with honor and service, but the sense in which we use it — a "worship service" — does not have a good English cognate.

We need to be careful that we do not assume too much when using this word.
