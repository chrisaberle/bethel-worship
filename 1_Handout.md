# 1: Introduction Handout

## Summary

> By the grace of God, Bethel exists as a church for Lake Charles and its surrounding communities where Godâ€™s worship and Word defines us, His Spirit changes us, and the Gospel of Jesus compels us.

We're starting in on a series that unpacks some key sections of Bethel's mission statement. The first thing we'll be covering is **"God's worship ... defines us."**

This week, we introduce the concept of **worship** broadly. We talk a bit about why we come to church on Sunday, and why we do the things we do while we're there.

## Term Overview

The term will be split into three broad chunks:

1. A Biblical Theology of worship
2. A Systematic Theology of worship
3. Practical and historical applications of these theologies

**Biblical Theology** attempts to tell the story of the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus. **Systematic theology** attempts to summarize all the Bible has to say about a certain topic. These two taken together inform how we **apply** the Bible's teaching to our own circumstances.

## Why are we here?

_Exercise:_ Here are some common answers to the question of why we come together in worship on Sundays. Spend some time considering how you would arrange a worship service if each answer was your _main concern_. Our goal here isn't to criticize, but instead to think through the major elements you'd include and how you'd design a service to achieve the listed goal.

1. Sunday Worship is for **evangelism**.

<br />
<br />

2. Sunday Worship is for the **education** of the church.

<br />
<br />

3. Sunday Worship is meant to **encourage** and build up the church.

<br />
<br />

4. Sunday Worship is for the praise and **exaltation** of God.

<br />
<br />

## What are we doing? Why are we doing it?

_Exercise:_ Spend some time thinking through Bethel's own worship service. How is our service divided? Why do we divide it up this way? For major elements like music or preaching, how do we differ from other PCA churches and churches in our community? What does this say about our values and priorities?

## Common Errors

_Exercise:_ Each of the answers given in the first exercise are connected to common errors we see in modern worship services. Now it's time to think critically: if this was your main goal, how might it lead to a distorted or unbalanced worship service?

Note: Each of these emphases is still an important part of a worship service. What would happen if you focused on one of these areas at the expense of the others?

1. Sunday Worship is for **Evangelism**

<br />
<br />

2. Sunday Worship is for **Education**

<br />
<br />

3. Sunday Worship as **Experience**

<br />
<br />

4. Sunday Worship is for **Exaltation** of God
