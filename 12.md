# 12: Final Week

This week, we're wrapping up our term on worship. We're going to spend our time reviewing what we've learned, and talking a bit about Sunday School in general and its purpose at Bethel.

## Why do we do Sunday School?

What is the purpose of Sunday School?

This is one of those questions which seems at first blush to have an easy answer, but it is in fact a difficult question to answer well. Sunday School has changed considerably over the last 300 years — it has been used to teach basic literacy to poor children, it has served a a cultural center and sports organization, and for a time it was a considerable tool for evangelism. Adult Sunday School as we know it has really only been popular since the last half of the 20th century. 

This wide range of purposes makes a certain kind of sense. When you gather the people of God together outside of traditional worship to learn together, you can set out to do a great number of things. To extend a familiar metaphor: when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. And when you have a nail, everything looks like a hammer. In different times and places, Sunday School can be used for different things.

We're all importing basic assumptions about Bethel's needs, and how what we're doing here addresses them. It's worth taking just a moment to uncover some of those assumptions.

**Question:** Why do you come to Sunday School? 
**Question:** What need exists at Bethel that you want Sunday School to accomplish?

There are two unique features of Sunday School that I'd like to highlight:

1. Sunday School addresses the **mind** of the Christian in a unique way. What we do here shares many similarities with sermons, but there is more freedom with the material. We are able to cover a broader range of topics in greater depth. One way of putting it is that Sunday School can be focused on **meat** over **milk** in a way that sermons cannot. It is a unique opportunity to develop a particular kind of Christian maturity. It's also a powerful tool for cultural formation of the local church.
2. Sunday School is interactive. We can hear from one another and fellowship with one another. This interaction can be both rewarding and challenging. We can sharpen each other. This of course means that there is occasionally friction.

In this season of Bethel, I'd like to suggest a few goals we should all be committed to in Sunday School:

1. **Christian Maturity**: This is a unique opportunity to learn more about issues we might not encounter in a sermon. It should not end with Sunday School, however. If a topic interests you, it should guide your personal study throughout the week. If you know what's coming in a future week, prepare for it. Sunday School can lead to cultural formation in a church, but only if we put in the effort and allow ourselves to be shaped by it.
2. **Training Leaders**: In Ephesians, God says teachers are given to the church for the equipping of the saints. We do not have many deeply experienced teachers in our congregation. Bethel needs teachers, and this is where they are made. The _teacher_ is being matured by the students, and students should participate with this in mind.
3. **Unity**: As Reformed folk, one of our strengths — theological depth — can also become a weakness: we may be tempted dispute and divide over finer points of doctrine. We should be using this time to draw closer to each other over questions that arise in class. If you find yourself frustrated with somebody in class, _lean in_. It's a good excuse to invite them over to lunch.

Do not think that I'm offering these ideas from a place of rebuke or disappointment. This is an encouragement. I've enjoyed teaching this term thoroughly, and I'm grateful to you all for putting up with me. Some of my favorite weeks have been the weeks _after_ a particularly chewy Sunday School. It's given me a chance to sit down with folks and grow closer to them. I want this for everybody!

## What did we learn?

**Question:** Name one key takeaway you had from this term.

1. We learned that worship is two sided, and an expression of the Chief End of Man in the WCF: glorifying God and enjoying him. We give _and_ receive in worship.
2. We looked at Covenant Renewal as a possible pattern of worship that fits our existing liturgy well. God calls, consecrates, commands, communes, and commissions us in the service. Covenants describe God's relationships with his people, and worship is a time where we remember various aspects of this relationship.
3. We looked at **Temple** and **Sabbath** and how they both picture a restoration of God's good creation. Worship of God looks back to the finished work of Christ and forward to His coming Kingdom.
4. We talked about three principles the church has used when making worship decisions: **Regulative**, **Normative**, and **Inventive**. We talked about how most decisions in worship will actually employ all three of these principles.
5. We talked about **elements**, **forms** and **circumstances** and how they connect to the three principles. We settled on three basic elements that are always included in corporate worship: **Word**, **response** and **Sacrament**.
6. We looked at **forms** of worship that can give us patterns for making detailed decisions like order, arrangement, and content. We looked at historic examples of worship, like temple worship and synagogue worship, and how they have shaped our modern church service. 

## Term Takeaways

There are a few takeaways from this term I want to emphasize:

1. Our mission statement says that as Bethel, God's worship _defines us_. Worship is a picture of the restoration of Eden, uniting us with God and each other. Corporate worship is the most important thing we do each week, and we should form habits in our lives that prepare us for it.
2. The PCA purposefully maintains a diversity of worship, and while some see this as a weakness, I see this as a strength. While we agree on the big-picture principles, Scripture gives us a long leash in how we practice these principles — even the strictest Regulativists affirm this. We should regard other methods and traditions with humility. Designing worship is _hard._
3. As we search for a new pastor, we should hold our liturgy with an open hand. Our liturgy may change. This is basically point #2, but it's worth underscoring in this unique season in our church's life.
