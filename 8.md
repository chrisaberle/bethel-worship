# 8: The Regulative Principle of Worship

## Review

<!-- SLOW DOWN -->

Last week, we finished our discussion on the three spheres of worship: individual, family, and corporate. 

The WCF states in 21.6:

>God is to be worshipped everywhere, in spirit and truth; as in
private families daily, and in secret each one by himself; so, more solemnly, in the public assemblies, which are not carelessly or willfully to be neglected, or forsaken, when God, by His Word or providence, calleth thereunto.

This sums up our takeaways nicely:

1. Individual and family worship are necessary to fulfill God's command to worship Him often, and are helpful — probably even necessary — means to Christian maturity.
2. Corporate worship is the most complete form of worship, especially when one considers the sacraments and the NT images of consummated worship.
3. It makes sense then to order our private and family liturgies after corporate worship. We should consider these activities preparation for Game Day.

As we study the elements of worship in future weeks, we'll double back on individual and family worship and discuss ways that we can shape them to support corporate worship.

## Principles of Worship

How do we decide what we should do in corporate worship? This is a difficult question, and church history provides us with many potential answers. We are essentially asking a question about authority: what authority do we appeal to when making decisions about worship, and what are the boundaries of this authority?

We can categorize these answers into three principles practiced throughout the church: **The Inventive Principle**, **The Normative Principle**, and **The Regulative Principle.**

### The Inventive Principle of Worship

In this view, the Church is the final authority on worship and is free to **invent** practices and methods that it feels are appropriate when ordering worship.

This is the principle that underlies Anglo-Catholic traditions that place a heavy emphasis on church authority. **The Mass** and **The Book of Common Prayer** both strictly define the entire substance, and many details, of worship in their traditions. Every word spoken by a priest, every prayer, every Bible reading, and even the text for the sermon are predefined. 

The Reformation was as much a reformation of worship as it was a reformation of soteriology and the doctrines of grace. The **_Solas_** were developed in reaction to errant doctrines about authority. Those errant doctrines gave birth to other errors — **Transubstantiation**, **Sacerdotalism**, **Indulgences**, **Veneration**, &c. — that were also addressed by the Reformers. It is important to keep this conversation in mind when studying the systemization of Reformed worship.

This week we'll take a look at Luther, Calvin, and small portions of Reformation-era confessions. 

### The Normative Principle of Worship

<!-- SLOW DOWN -->

The Normative Principle of Worship states that whatever is not prohibited in Scripture is permitted in worship, so long as it is agreeable to the peace and unity of the church. This is the view held by Luther, and it is the view still taught by Lutherans today.

The name **The Normative Principle** doesn't match well with the doctrine itself. That's because the emphasis of the doctrine has changed over time. Originally, the idea was that the patterns and examples of the Bible can serve as patterns and examples for us today, even if there are no explicit commands for us to do it that way.

It is important to note that this principle still locates its authority **in Scripture alone**. For Luther, the Bible was the ultimate source of authority for worship.

## The Regulative Principle of Worship

Like Luther, Calvin also taught that Scripture was the ultimate authority for shaping and structuring worship. Unlike Luther, Calvin taught that only what is commanded in Scripture is permitted in worship. This is **The Regulative Principle of Worship**, and is the principle generally followed by Reformed traditions, including Presbyterianism.

At the center of this doctrine are two propositions:

1. God cares about and communicates to us how he is to be worshipped. There are many OT examples (Cain, Nadab and Abihu, Saul, Uzziah) of people who violate God's prescription and suffer grave consequences.
2. **Total Depravity** suggests that we are not capable of inventing worship that pleases God. As Calvin says in _Institutes IV.X17_: "It must be regarded as a fixed principle that all modes of worship devised by man are detestable."

### Examples

<!-- SLOW DOWN -->

In contrast to **The Inventive Principle** and **The Normative Principle**, **The Regulative Principle** was taught widely amongst the Reformers and the various Reformation confessions.

>The acceptable way of worshipping the true God is instituted by Himself, and so limited by His own revealed will, that He may not be worshipped according to the imaginations and devices of men, or the suggestions of Satan, under any visible representation, or any other way not prescribed in the holy Scripture. _WCF 21_

> Q. What does God require in the second commandment? A. We are not to make an image of God in any way, nor to worship Him in any other manner than He has commanded in His Word. _Heidelberg Catechism, Q96_

>Those who govern the churches ought always to guard against deviating from what Christ, our only Master, has ordained for us. Therefore we reject all human innovations and all laws imposed on us, in our worship of God, which bind and force our consciences in any way. So we accept only what is proper to maintain harmony and unity and to keep all in obedience to God. _Belgic Confession, Article 32_

### Application

<!-- SLOW DOWN -->

**The Regulative Principle** can seem very limiting, but it is important to keep the context of its development in mind. During the Reformation, and later during the Puritan movement, **The Regulative Principle** was a means of **freeing** God's people from the tyranny of man-made liturgical constraints. The traditions which the Reformers were seeking to correct were **more** prescriptive than the principles they proposed. "You can't tell me how to worship, only **God** can do that!" isn't an unfair summary of the doctrine. 

Despite its popularity, applying **The Regulative Principle** is actually very difficult. Because temple worship was fulfilled and sometimes even abrogated by Jesus, OT commands are not generally considered applicable to the **Regulative Principle.** Problematically, the NT contains very few explicit commands that direct our worship. Nowhere do we have an explicit, systematic statement of how to order our activities on The Lord's Day.

Instead, the **Regulative Principle** is extended according to another rule, **good and necessary consequence.** Proponents of **The Regulative Principle** also hold that certain activities can be logically deduced from the Bible and considered binding:

1. The Second Commandment is frequently expanded to prohibit worship that is not directed toward God in the methods prescribed by Him.
2. The public reading of the Bible is assumed in 1 Timothy 4:13.
3. The preaching of the Bible is assumed in 1 Timothy 4:2.
4. The singing of the Bible (psalms, hymns, spiritual songs) is assumed in Ephesians 5:19 and Colossians 3:16.
5. The Sacraments of The Eucharist and Baptism are inferred as appropriate from Matthew, Acts, 1 Corinthians, and Colossians.
6. Oaths, vows, solemn fasts, and thanksgivings are all recognized as Scripturally warranted by the WCF (21:5).

### Problems

<!-- SLOW DOWN -->

Of course, the difficulty is always in the details. There are a number of areas of controversy that arise when churches start to apply **The Regulative Principle** to a traditional church service:

1. The use of instruments and dancing have been debated since the Reformation. There are only OT examples of their use, and mostly within a Temple context. Some Reformers maintained that instruments were idolatry and a violation of the second commandment. Calvin held different views in Geneva and Strasbourg. 
2. The offering, or the giving of alms, is not commanded specifically within a worship context.
3. Baptism is never explicitly commanded within a worship context, and frequently occurs outside of it.
4. No holidays besides the Lord's Day are commanded in the NT, and in fact Paul teaches that they are a matter of individual conscience.
5. We don't even get a **basic outline** of worship that approaches explicit command in the NT. Some have taught that because Jesus attended synagogue, he surely approved of it, so that is a good starting place.

The fact is, strictly holding to **The Regulative Principle** is very difficult, requires some significant stretches of logic, and has never really been practiced. 

## So Chris, Dude, Seriously, What Do We Even Do

<!-- SLOW DOWN -->

What we've just discussed isn't exactly news to anybody. The WCF — and the PCA governing documents, for that matter — recognize this. It's one of the reasons why the PCA allows such diversity in worship.

I like Jeff Meyers' take on **The Regulative Principle**. Citing Bucer's formulation of **The Regulative Principle**, he suggests that we should have some plausible Biblical precedent for everything we do in worship. Instead of stretching **good and necessary consequence** to **bad and quite frankly super-skinny-branch consequence**, we admit that the New Covenant leaves us a lot of wiggle room. 

I think it's also helpful to look back to Luther. Because **The Regulative Principle** is not as extensible as we like, at some point, **The Normative Principle** plays a necessary part. Indeed, **The Inventive Principle** also comes into play. Consider these questions:

1. When do we schedule our service? 
2. Do Deacons pray after the offering? 
3. Should we have kneelers?
4. When should announcements happen?

In answering these questions, I suggest a priority order: regulate, normalize, invent. In any _actual_ detailed decision about how we worship, I think it's inescapable that we will do all three.

## Takeaways

As you think through the lesson this week, keep the following questions in mind:

1. What Biblical warrant do we have for what we do in worship? How does that extend to your family? Your private prayer?
2. In what ways could our worship change and still be acceptable to God? Where should we draw a line?
