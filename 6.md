# 6: The Three Spheres of Worship

## Review

This is the halfway point of the term. So far, we've covered the following:

1. We talked about why we worship, and discussed several popular answers to the question — evangelism, education, experience, and exaltation of God. True worship is about all of these things, and errors arise when we overemphasize one aspect at the expense of the others.
2. We talked about the Hebrew and Greek words for worship, and how they map onto our English word. We also proposed a model for structuring worship — covenant renewal — which incorporates all of the reasons for worship we discussed in week one.
3. We used the tools of Biblical Theology to cover major themes in the Bible that relate to worship. In week three we discussed temple: Eden was a temple, Adam was a priest, and the story of the Bible can be explained as a story about God restoring temple and dwelling again with his priestly people.
4. We spent two weeks talking about Sabbath and the peace and plenty of Eden. For Israel, Sabbath was about remembering the completeness of God's creation and His promise to restore that completeness.

Over the next six weeks, we'll be focusing on applying all of this to the practical question of how we should worship in the New Covenant. This kind of work is often described as **Systematic Theology.**

## Systematic Theology and Biblical Theology

Biblical Theology and Systematic Theology are distinct and complementary disciplines. It's important to note what we're doing here:

1. Biblical Theology seeks to tell the whole story of the Bible as a unified story that culminates in Jesus. It is concerned with **exegesis**, and involves placing passages in their appropriate context so we can determine **what they mean.**
2. Systematic Theology is concerned with organizing all of the biblical data on a particular topic so we can **apply** it to a particular question.

It's common for people to think of systematics as rather dry and academic. This is an error. We are always doing Systematic Theology. The Creeds and Councils are systematics. A discussion about abortion or economics or gun control is a question about systematics. 

This term we're considering worship. In the last several weeks we have looked at **what the Bible means** when we read words like worship and temple and covenant and Sabbath. We're now going to start breaking down worship into various topics and looking at what the Bible has to say about them.

## The Three Spheres of Worship

Just like the Puritans recognized three spheres of government, they also recognized three spheres of worship. There are three distinct yet overlapping contexts in which we worship.

### Individual Worship

This is worship that happens in private, or as Jesus puts it, in your closet.

1. There is no direct command in scripture to have anything like a quiet time. But Jesus himself frequently spent time alone in prayer (Luke 5:16), sometimes all night (Luke 6:12). Godly people in scripture are marked by this habit, and we are told to imitate them (Hebrews 13:7, Ephesians 5:1).
2. Jesus **assumes** this kind of habit (Matthew 6:5).
3. Psalm 92:2 exhorts us to worship God in the morning and in the night; Hebrews 13:15 tells us to "continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God." Corporate worship is not frequent enough to fit this pattern.

### Family Worship

This is worship that happens as a gathered family. Many of us do this once a day; the Puritans and many church traditions call for it at least twice a day.

1. God's commands and covenants happen in the context of family. Even after Israel is a nation and has the Levitical rights, upon entering the Promised Land, Joshua assumes the basic unit of faithfulness is the family (Joshua 24:15).
2. Job confessed on behalf of his children (Job 1:5).
3. Faithfulness for Abraham meant instructing his household (Genesis 18:18-19). Deuteronomy 6 highlights the importance of family instruction.
4. Circumcision happens within the boundaries of the family. Though Baptism changes and is administered by the church, in Acts it still often happens happens by household.
5. Jeremiah 31, the only explicit reference to the New Covenant in the OT, is full of family language. God's promises in the OT are generational.

### Corporate Worship

We will study corporate worship for the rest of the term. This week, we'll just consider a few highlights:

1. There are few explicit NT commands to worship weekly. Hebrews 10:25 is the most direct.
2. Like individual worship, corporate worship is **assumed** when it is taught. The church in Acts met daily, 1 Corinthians 11 and 14 both begin with "When you come together"
3. Hebrews 12:22 also gives us the most direct description of an actual worship service — corporate worship pictures for us the fulfillment of a great deal of OT imagery.
4. The first century church **added** to preexisting worship practices rather than replacing them. They went to synagogue on Saturday, and on Sunday they practiced Lord's Day meetings. The Lord's Supper was added. Agape Feasts were added to community life and included prayer.
5. Corporate worship is the kind of worship that happens in heaven. A good picture of this is Revelation 19.

## Discussion

1. How do these spheres overlap and reinforce one another?
2. Which sphere is most important?
3. Which spheres will be present in the New Creation, and in what ways might they change?
4. How can Bethel support families and individuals in worship?
