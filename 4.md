# 4: Sabbath and The Lord's Day

## Review

Last week we talked about temple and traced its development in the Bible. It is possible to tell the whole biblical story using temple as a narrative:

1. Eden is a **temple**. It is a place where God dwells with his people. Adam is given priestly duties. Because of the Fall, Adam and Eve are sent eastward out of God's presence.
2. Noah, Abraham, Jacob and Moses all meet God on **mountains**, and these events include temple imagery.
3. The **Tabernacle** reminds us of Eden, and the instructions given in Leviticus allow Moses and the High Priest to re-enter God's presence.
4. **Solomon's** **Temple** replaces the tabernacle and builds on the Eden imagery. Israel disobeys God, is **exiled** from the Promised Land, and no longer enjoys God's presence.
5. Nehemiah rebuilds the **Temple**, but its power and God's presence are diminished. The priesthood is corrupt. The prophets promise a **new** **temple** which intensifies Eden imagery and promises God's presence.
6. God's presence returns in the person of Jesus. His death reopens our access to the **Most Holy Place**.
7. At **Pentecost**, God's presence indwells His people. We are now living stones in His new **Temple**, with Christ as the cornerstone.
8. In Revelation the **New Heavens and Earth** are depicted as a new Eden. There is now no Temple because **God** is the temple and He dwells freely with His people.

This week we will do a similar retelling of the biblical story using Sabbath and seventh-day rest as our theme. 

## Creation

The fundamental pattern for Sabbath, like most biblical themes, begins on the first pages of the Bible. God teaches his people that the festivals they'll be commanded to celebrate are baked right into the creation order.

### Seasons

In [Genesis 1](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/genesis/1.shtml), God creates in two sets of three: in the first three days, he separates chaos from chaos and creates ordered spaces (sky, water, earth). In the second three days, he creates inhabitants for these spaces. In Genesis 1:14, God places lights in the expanse of heaven, and they are given "for signs and for seasons and for days and for years." Our modern translations can be misleading here. When we read "seasons," we tend to think of our four seasons: spring, summer, fall, winter. But the word "seasons" here is the same word used of the holy days Israel is commanded to celebrate in Leviticus. God gives order to time itself. He inaugurates the first celebration on the seventh day by resting.

### Sevens

Genesis 1 is _full_ of sevens. The first sentence is seven words long. The second is 14. Important words like "God" occur in multiples of seven. Genesis 1 is seven paragraphs; God blesses Adam and Eve with a three-line poem of seven words in each line. "Seven", "complete", "oath", and "shabbat" are all very similar looking in Hebrew.

###  Peace and Plenty

Though Adam is commanded to work and keep the garden, in [Genesis 2:8](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/genesis/2.shtml) God _nuachs_ Adam in the Garden — he rests him there. _Nuach_ and _shabbat_ will appear together later in the Sabbath commands. The condition of completeness (Hebrew _shalom_) in the Garden results in rest for its inhabitants.

Adam's work prior to the fall is not like work today. The Garden is abundant, and he may eat of trees which already bear fruit and give life. He is at peace with nature.

<!-- Rest requires recognizing that we have enough. The dichotomy of plenty and scarcity is important for understanding the dynamics of post-fall life. -->

Adam is also at peace with Eve, his _azer_ (Genesis 2:18). This word is only used elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible to describe God. Eve as created as a helper to do with Adam what he can not do alone — be fruitful and multiply. They are naked and unashamed.

Notably, the seventh day breaks the pattern of "evening and morning." It's a common and orthodox idea to see this difference as a suggestion that Sabbath rest was unending and a picture of eternity.

Man's disobedience ruins the **peace** and **plenty** of the Garden. The curses describe enmity between the inhabitants of God's creation. Last week, we described the broken relationship between God and man. This week, we will look at the broken relationships that form between man and nature and man and his neighbor. Sabbath, among other things, restores the _peace_ and _plenty_ we lost when these relationships were broken.

## 7 Curses and 7 Blessings

In Genesis 1-11, the word "curse" is used seven times. This is occasionally balanced with blessing, but the trajectory is downhill: by the time we reach Genesis 12 blessing has only been mentioned 3 times since God finished his work in Genesis 2:4.

1. Cain commits the first murder, and suffers further curse from the ground. Lamech the Cainite's boast in Genesis 4 echos and intensifies Cain's murder. Another Lamech names his son Noah, citing the curse on the ground and prophesying that Noah will bring rest.
2. On the seventh day of the seventh month, the ark comes to rest on Ararat. On the first day of the first month the waters recede: a new creation. There is still enmity between man and beast, however. Noah plants a vineyard perhaps restoring Eden. It is short lived. Ham is soon cursed. 
3. Two generations pass without blessing. Relationships between men further deteriorate because of Babel.

Abraham's story, however, restores the pattern of blessing first seen in Genesis 1. In particular, God speaks blessing to Abraham in a seven-line poem, which some see as a reversal of the seven curses in the preceding chapters. In the next three generations through Jacob, blessing is mentioned 81 times, and curses only three times.

Abraham is promised many children, told he will be a blessing to the nations, and promised a land. God intends to reverse the curse through Abraham.

Though we do not have time to go into it in detail, in Genesis 21 Abraham has an interaction with a king, Abimelech. He makes an oath (sheba, also similar to sabbath-seven), sacrifices seven lambs, and plants a tree by a well. He names the place _Beersheba_, The Well of Seven/The Oath. The story ends with Abraham calling on God in a new garden, at peace with the nations.

## Sabbath

_Exercise:_ When does God first give the command to practice Sabbath? 

We get two Sabbath commands, and there are significant differences between them. The first is in [Exodus 20](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/exodus/20.shtml). The reason God gives for practicing Sabbath is "in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy."

The restatement of the Sabbath command in Deuteronomy expands on this idea, however: "You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore the LORD your God commanded you to observe the sabbath day."

We see in both commandments the fact that Sabbath extends peace and plenty to neighbors and animals. The important idea of _release from slavery_ is added in Deuteronomy. Slavery and hard labor is a product of the fall; Sabbath is a picture that God will release us from the curse.

Sabbath is also involved with the collection of manna in the wilderness. Most of the week, if any was left over, it would rot. But on the sixth day, Israel was told to collect twice as much. It stayed good through the Sabbath: a picture of plenty in the wilderness.

These concepts are important precursors to Israel's festal calendar, which is a total bonanza of sevens and Sabbath rest.

## The Festal Calendar

Israel was commanded to celebrate seven holidays. Each was a picture of God's gracious provision and recalled key moments of God's redemptive work in the nation.

The cycle wasn't just weekly or monthly, however. The sevens stack.

### The Year of Release

<!-- Primary passage is Leviticus 25. -->

Every seventh year, there was a Sabbath year — _Shmita_, literally "release" — where Israel was to release debts and debt slaves. "There will be no poor among you, since the LORD will surely bless you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess." The commandment goes on to warn Israel that they should not harden their hearts and try to game the system. Even in the sixth year, they were to lend freely.

The year of release was also a time when Israel was to leave their fields fallow and give the _land_ rest ([Leviticus 25](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/leviticus/25.shtml)). What grew belonged to everybody to pick and eat freely, even livestock, just like the Garden of Eden.

### Jubilee

Every 50th year, Jubilee was declared. It was a total economic reset: debts were released and land was fallowed as in the year of release, but importantly, land ownership was also restored. The Fall creates calamity and poverty and loss, and over the course of a generation a family might lose their inheritance. Every Jubilee, Israel was completely restored to their original state when they entered the land. 

_Exercise:_ It's unclear whether Israel faithfully followed _Shmita_ and Jubilee. In our Western context, we see remnants of these doctrines. Which aspects of our economy mirror _Shmita_? How would our economy be different if we applied these laws strictly?

### A Brief Word on Solomon

The image of plenty in the Garden was an enduring image for Israel. Near the beginning of Solomon's reign, we read in [1 Kings 6](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/1_kings/6.shtml) that "...Judah and Israel lived in safety, every man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon."

When Israel had a wise king, he restored Eden to the people. They lived in peace and plenty.

## The Lord of the Sabbath

Jesus deals extensively with Sabbath during his ministry. A key to understanding his teaching is that he is not reinterpreting Sabbath, but rather fulfilling it.

1. When Jesus announces his ministry in [Luke 4](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/luke/4.shtml), he uses Shmita to do so. It is common to over-spiritualize this passage, but actual release and healing is clearly in view.
2. In [Matthew 11](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/matthew/11.shtml) (14, 28-30) and again in [Matthew 12](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/matthew/12.shtml), Jesus teaches about Sabbath. He teaches that his yoke (a significant word to Jews) is light. His disciples pick grain freely as if they're in a garden.
3. Jesus' resurrection occurs on the first day of a new week. Pentecost, which happens seven weeks and one day after Passover Sabbath, is when he sends his spirit. 

## Takeaways

_Exercise:_ In future weeks, we'll unpack how to apply these teachings today. For now, consider how Sabbath is fulfilled in Jesus:

1. How are we to live in light of the fact that Jesus has brought us rest?
2. How has God restored our relationships with each other and with his creation?
3. Do we still live in a world of scarcity? How should we live as people who believe in God's abundance? Consider Acts and 2 Corinthians for ideas.
