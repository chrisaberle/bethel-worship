# 2: A Biblical Theology of Worship

[[toc]]

## Review

Last week we looked at various answers to the question **"What is the point of Sunday Worship?"** Today we'll begin to work on an answer to this question.

Worship is hard to define crisply. This is because it's connected to our theology and anthropology. The Westminster Catechism's first question sums this up well:

>Q. What is the chief end of man?</br>
>A. Man's chief end is to **glorify God**, and to **enjoy** him forever.

Man's chief end is twofold. The errors we discussed last week always favor one half of this end at the expense of the other. Most errors are man-centered — we focus on our response to or enjoyment of worship. But it is also possible to over-emphasize the exaltation of God, forgetting that God has created us for enjoyment of his many blessings.

### What is the Point of Sunday Worship?

_Exercise:_ We ended last week with an assignment to come up with our own answers to this question. What did you decide?

##  Definitions

<!-- ASK: How would you define worship? -->

The English word _worship_ does not correspond well to the original Hebrew and Greek words we encounter in the Bible. It comes from two Anglo Saxon roots, _weorth_ and _scipe_, and means roughly "worthiness; to ascribe worth." Think of other words in English that end in "ship" — headship, relationship, bipartisanship — to get an idea of how they go together.

**Hebrew**:</br>
_cagad, shachah._ To prostrate oneself, to prostrate in homage.

**Greek:** </br>
_proskuneo, 54 usages._ To prostrate oneself. One of the more common words for worship in the NT, and the word used in the key passage of the woman at the well ([John 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+4&version=NASB)). </br>
_latreuo, 21 usages_; To serve or worship, as in the work of a priest, used in [Romans 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12&version=NASB).</br>
_eusebeo, 2 usages;_ To honor or worship. Used by Paul at Mars Hill ([Acts 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+17&version=NASB)).

In the Bible, the word _worship_ often (most often, really) has a very narrow, physical sense. It is the literal act of bowing down to something, and carries with it the idea of kissing the hand of the object of worship. The Greek expands on this idea with honor and service, but the sense in which we use it — a "worship service" — does not have a good biblical equivalent.

We need to be careful when we talk about worship to define what we mean. Our English word doesn't represent the originals well, and we're usually importing extra context that can muddy our exegesis.

## Worship as Covenant Renewal

One way to think of worship, and the pattern we'll be using in this course, is that worship is **Covenant Renewal**. At the outset, we need a few qualifications:

1. This method of framing worship can be controversial. Some worry that it tends to sacramentalism. I don't think this is the case. 
2. This is not the only framing mechanism for worship available to us in the Reformed tradition. It is the one that I think fits Bethel's culture best. We'll explore others throughout the course.

Given these caveats, why choose covenant? Well, worship is a big topic. We need a big broom to sweep through the whole Bible and pick up all of the relevant bits. Covenant is a big enough broom. In particular:

1. Covenant defines the relationship between God and man. If worship flows from the doctrines of God and man, covenant is unavoidable in the discussion.
2. The Levitical code is some of the most explicit worship teaching in the Bible. How we apply it today relies heavily on how we understand the Old and New covenants.
3. Temple imagery is often connected to worship in the New Testament. Covenantal thinking helps us trace how this idea develops.
4. What you believe about the sacraments, a key element of worship, is a consequence of what you believe about the covenants.

In the next two weeks, we'll be using two other big brooms: temple and sabbath. Neither do quite as much for us as covenant, however. We'll be using covenant as our primary framework, and temple and sabbath will round out our Biblical Theology section before we move to Systematics.

### A Pattern for Defining Covenants

Covenants come in many shapes and sizes. In the ancient period, covenants were how relationships were formalized. Individuals would covenant in marriage, to define business relationships, or to formalize oaths. Rulers would also covenant with their people; covenants like these were basically ancient constitutions. 

God used this well-known pattern to communicate to His people. What is remarkable about this is that a God covenanting with his people was unheard of in the ancient world. 

Because covenant formalized relationships, and because no two relationships are really the same, covenants don't follow a strict pattern. This is even more the case with God's covenants, which had no precedent in the ancient near east. Still, we may observe the following general patterns in the Bible:

1. God initiates, taking hold of something.
2. God separates and makes something new.
3. God speaks, stipulating the covenant.
4. God provides signs and seals of the covenant.
5. God arranges for the future.

We don't have time to walk through all four explicit (five generally recognized in Reformed tradition) covenants today. Let's do three.

### The Covenant of Works

This is not an explicit covenant but widely recognized to be one. Write down how the pattern above can be seen in [Genesis 2](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/genesis/2.shtml):

1. How does God initiate or take hold?
<!-- God takes hold of the earth he has created. -->
</br>
</br>

2. What does God separate? What new thing does he make?
<!-- He separates dust from dust and breathes life into the dust. -->
</br>
</br>

3. What does God speak? What does he stipulate?
<!-- He puts Adam into the garden to cultivate and keep it, and tells him not to eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. -->
</br>
</br>

4. What are the signs, seals, or rituals of this covenant?
<!-- The two trees, a meal, representing life of obedience and death of disobedience. -->
</br>
</br>

5. How does God arrange for the future succession of this covenant?
<!-- He creates Eve and gives them an additional blessing. -->
</br>
</br>

### The Mosaic Covenant

This is the most detailed covenant in the Bible, and one we'll be considering in depth in future weeks. It will be helpful to have these categories in mind as we study.

1. How does God initiate or take hold?
<!-- He takes hold of his people in slavery and bondage. -->
</br>
</br>

2. What does God separate? What new thing does he make?
<!-- He separates them from Egypt, separates the Red Sea, gives them a new name (Israel), gives himself a new name (Yahweh). -->
</br>
</br>

3. What does God speak? What does he stipulate?
<!-- The law, obvs. -->
</br>
</br>

4. What are the signs, seals, or rituals of this covenant?
<!-- Tabernacle, priesthood, Levitical system, Passover. -->
</br>
</br>

5. How does God arrange for the future succession of this covenant?
<!-- Deut 32-34, the blessings and curses. -->
</br>
</br>

### The New Covenant

Finally, we'll consider how this all works in the New Covenant. In addition to these answers, think about Bethel's order of worship and how it corresponds to these steps. 

1. How does God initiate or take hold?
<!-- He takes on human flesh. -->
</br>
</br>

2. What does God separate? What new thing does he make?
<!-- Jesus suffers the separation of death, but becomes the New Adam and a new King. -->
</br>
</br>

3. What does God speak? What does he stipulate?
<!-- The whole New Testament, basically. Also, "love one another." -->
</br>
</br>

4. What are the signs, seals, or rituals of this covenant?
<!-- Baptism, The Lord's Supper. -->
</br>
</br>

5. How does God arrange for the future succession of this covenant?
<!-- The Great Commission. -->
</br>
</br>
