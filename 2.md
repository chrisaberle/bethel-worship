# A Biblical Theology of Worship

## Last week

Last week we looked at various answers to the question **"What is the point of Sunday Worship?"** Today we'll begin to work on an answer to this question.

Worship is a very rich topic that is difficult to summarize quickly. This is because it is connected to our entire doctrine of God and man. The Westminster Catechism's first question is an excellent illustration of this point:

>Q. What is the chief end of man?
>A. Man's chief end is to **glorify God**, and to **enjoy** him forever.

Man's chief end is twofold. The errors we discussed last week tend to favor one half of this end at the expense of the other. Most errors are man-centered — we focus on our response to or enjoyment of worship. But it is also possible to over-emphasize the exaltation of God, forgetting that God has created us for enjoyment of his many blessings.

## What is the Point of Sunday Worship?

_Exercise:_ We ended last week with an assignment to come up with our own answers to this question. What did you decide?

##  Definitions

The English word _worship_ does not correspond well to the original Hebrew and Greek words we encounter in the Bible. It comes from two Anglo Saxon roots, _worth_ and _scip_, and means roughly "to ascribe worth." Think of other words in English that end in "ship" — headship, dictatorship, bipartisanship — to get an idea of how they go together.

**Hebrew**: _cagad, shachah;_ To prostrate oneself, to prostrate in homage.

**Greek:** _proskuneo;_ To prostrate oneself. One of the more common words for worship in the NT, and the word used in the key passage of the woman at the well ([John 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+4&version=NASB)). _eusebeo;_ To honor or worship. Used by Paul at Mars Hill ([Acts 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+17&version=NASB)). _latreuo_; To serve or worship, used in [Romans 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12&version=NASB).

In the Bible, the word _worship_ typically has a very narrow, physical sense. It is the literal act of bowing down to something. The Greek expands on this idea with honor and service, but the sense in which we use it — a "worship service" — does not have a good biblical equivalent.

We need to be careful that we do not assume too much when using this word.

## Worship as Covenant Renewal

Because the English word _worship_ is such a poor stand-in for the originals, and because
