# Lesson Two: A Biblical Theology of Worship from Shadow to Antitype

In this lesson we will trace worship from Eden to Sinai to the New Creation.

In the progress of revelation the Old Covenant worship is a type, a shadow, a copy, one that points forward to the fulfillment of worship in the New Covenant. Old Testament worship reaches its climax in Christ and the New Covenant. in this lesson we will trace the development of worship from its beginning in the garden of Eden in Genesis 2 and 3,, and then consider the worship of the old covenant established at Sinai in Exodus 19, and the we will consider the fullness of worship that was introduced under the New Covenant, firstly in Jesus coming (John 4) , then in the early church, (Hebrews 12) and finally in the climax at the end of the book of revelation in Revelation 21,22.   

## Worship in Eden, the Temple and the New Creation

In Genesis we see Adam as the first prophet, priest, and king. As a king he was told to extend God's dominion from the garden so it could cover the whole earth. As a prophet he called and named the animals in the garden, declaring God's will. As a priest, the Garden of Eden was the original temple, the place were God met with men. He met and worshipped God in the Garden of Eden. Adam was called to tend or guard the garden and extend it over the whole creation.

The main focus of this lesson is the idea that the garden is the very first temple of God in which Adam acted as a priest. This is important as it will help us to understand the role of the temple which was put up later in Israel.

1.	As we consider the temple it was given to the nation of Israel it looked back to the Garden. It was a  copy and a shadow of the original garden.
2.	At the same time, as the original garden of Eden looked forward to the new creation, so the temple given to Israel was also pointing forwards to the coming of the New Creation, one initially coming in Christ, one which is being extended through Christ's people who are the living temple indwelt by the Holy Spirit 2 Cor 6 FF and
3.	Which awaits the time me when then garden temple will cover the whole of the new creation.   

The original creation was divided into three: the garden, Eden, and the rest of creation (Gen. 2:8-10). The garden was man's dwelling and man was to extend the garden until it covered the whole creation (Gen. 1:28). In the garden of Eden, each of the three areas shows increasing holiness. First we have Eden, God's dwelling; second, the garden, Adam's workplace; and third, the world outside the garden, not the garden but still 'very good'. God met man in the garden.

The three-fold division which also reflects increasing holiness  is repeated in the temple.  There is the (most) Holy of Holy's Place of God, the next holy place for the priests (the garden), and outside the temple for everyone else.

The parallel between the orginal garden and the temple is also seen in other ways. It can be seen in   words used for God 'meeting man' in the garden which is the same as the words that stressed God being in the midst of Israel.

And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden (Gen. 3:8)

And I will walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be my people (Lev. 26:12).

Because the LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you and to give up your enemies before you, therefore your camp must be holy, so that He may not see anything indecent among you and turn away from you  (Deut. 23:14).

Adam was commanded by God to cultivate and keep the garden. This agricultural command is the same word used of the priests serving and guarding in the tabernacle in 1 Chronicles 9:23 and 2 Chronicles 23:19.  

The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it. (Gen 2:15)

So they and their sons were in charge of the gates of the house of the Lord, that is, the house of the tent, as guards (1 Chronicles 9:23)

He stationed the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the Lord so that no one should enter who was in any way unclean (2 Chronicles 23:19).  

As a priest Adam was to guard the garden-temple from evil and uncleanness,  to stop any unclean thing (the serpent/Satan) from entering into it. In Ezekiel the priests are temple wardens who had to guard the temple (Ezek. 40:45; 44:24).

In the same way Adam is to be fruitful, multiply, and fill the whole earth, Adam was to extend the garden/temple throughout the creation. If Adam was obedient, the whole of the old creation was to be turned into the garden/temple with Adam as its priest and image bearer (Beale 82; Kline 1989: 55-56). The aim is for the entire creation to become the garden, the new temple.

It is important to see the link between the garden and the temple as they  us that
1) Eden was the first temple,
2) that the temple given to Israel is a mere copy of Eden, and
3) that the whole of the new creation will bring in the fulfillment of the temple of God. That is why there is no temple in the final city in revelation as the whole of the city/creation will be the temple. As John says:  I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. (Rev 21:22)

Adam failed. He allowed the serpent, an unclean thing, to beguile him, and he sinned. This defiled the original garden and so unclean Adam could not remain in the garden/holy place of God, and was exiled. Adam was barred from the garden temple God placed cherubim to stand guard at the entrance of the garden. (Gen. 3:24).  Adam's path blocked by an angel with a flaming sword (Gen. 3:24).

We see a parallel in the temple. The high priest is barred from entering itn God presence, and he could only do it once a year. Just as the angel guards the garden so the cherubim have the same function in the temple, the two cherubim stand symbolically guarding the Ark of the Covenant (Exod. 26:18-22)  over it. The curtains that separate the holy of holies from the holy place are filled with  in the holy place are also filled with angels. They bar the way into the Holy Place, so men in Adam  can only enter into the temple through the high priest. In Israel, only the priest and high priest has access into the presence of God and once a year. Looking forward to the new covenant Jesus comes as the greater high priest, the one who is both the priest and the offering. In His death He enters the Holy Place and the temple veil is ripped, showing that in Him the way into the Holy Place is opened.  In the end scripture the  whole of the new creation is now the temple. The original creation was to extend over the whole of creation (Ps. 8) and Christ brings this to fulfillment. In Him, he initially brings in a the new creation in his life death and resurrection and as he rules the whole of the new creation is taken under his Lordship and become the new temple of God. Only those who have the Lamb enter the new creation.
2. Sinai '' Temple Worship

In this section we will consider the worship of God at Sanai. God delivered Israel in order that they might worship and serve Him (Exod. 3:18, 24:1). God met Israel at Mount Sinai. Through the preparation for this meeting with God, God's revelation and the giving of the Ten Commandments by God, the principles on how they were to approach God in worship were revealed to the Israelites.

When Israel first reached the mountain, God told them how to draw near to Him. Then the LORD said to Moses, 'Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes. And let them be ready for the third day. For on the third day the LORD will come down upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. You shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, 'Take heed to yourselves that you do not go up to the mountain or touch its base. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.  Not a hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot with an arrow; whether man or beast, he shall not live.' When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come near the mountain' (Exod. 19:10-13).  

Mount Sinai was a threatening scary place. Unclean Israel was approaching a holy God. To stress His holiness, God revealed Himself to Israel through frightening powerful signs, signs that stressed His majesty and their uncleanness before Him. In order to approach Him, the Israelites were to consecrate and wash themselves, and they were warned not to touch the mountain where He would come. Through these actions, God stressed His holiness, their uncleanness, and the terrifying nature of the meeting.

In fear the people chose Moses as mediator, and asked him to enter God's presence for them. Now all the people witnessed the thunderings, the lightning flashes, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they trembled and stood afar off. Then they said to Moses, 'You speak with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die' (Exod. 20:18, 19).   Moses is the great mediator of the Old Covenant.

The worship in Israel is a type and shadow of the worship to come. every aspect of the old testament and old testament worship pints us forwards to the greater fulfillment in the olnew testament. In Colossians 2 we read 16 Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. 17 These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.

Diagram, worship in Israel as a type of that which was to come.

All the principles at Sanai are reflected in a new and greater way in the new covenant, and we will consider these after we have considered the use of the 10 commandments in worship.

2.1. The Ten Commandments and Old Testament Worship.
At Sanai God then gave the Ten Commandments to Moses to give to the people. The first four commandments regulate Israel's relationship with God and it's worship.

1. God is the object of worship  (1st Commandment).
2. God instructs Israel on how they are to worship  (2nd Commandment).
3. God warns Israel to honor His name (3rd Commandment).
4. God commands Israel to set aside one day to worship (4th Commandment).

In the first and the second commandment God tells Israel about worship. In their discussions the Reformers stressed the importance of the second commandment in formulating principles of worship and the regulative principle. This was particularly important in countering the Roman Catholic church use of manmade idols to aid in worship. The second commandment stresses not only that God has to be worshipped, and it warned about the use of idols. but it lays down the general principle of how He is to be worshiped. The second commandment states:

'You shall not make for yourself a carved image'any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them' (Exod. 20:4).

The commandment warns Israel of two errors in respect of images; they were not to make a carved image of any likeness in heaven and they were not to serve those images.
2.1. No Idols
Idolatry is the creation of a false image of God, or a false god.  The commandment stresses that the image must not be based upon any likeness
a. in heaven above,
b. on earth,
c. or underwater.
These three spheres encompass the whole of the created order.

In Deuteronomy 4:15, God reminds Israel of this commandment and very importantly he reminds Israel that when they met Him, they did not see any form on the mountain. This is the heart of the second commandment. If men seek to worship God through any created form, it is sin as it will lead to worshiping the visible creation, not the invisible creator. This is true even though it seems that God has revealed Himself in many forms over time, yet in each case the revelation both reveals and obscure God. He was revealed and concealed in the burning bush, the pillar of cloud and fire, in the Angel of the Lord and even though we have these examples God's word is clear; we are not to try to use any of these or any other  forms in our worship. In Romans 1:18ff, Paul warns of the folly and idolatry of men when they worship the creation. As men, we only have two real options, we can worship the Creator or the creation.
2.2. Do Not Worship Idols
The second warning is not to bow down and worship any image. We have already been told we should not make any image, and God now reinforces the idea by commanding that we are not to worship them. How easy it is to break this commandment is seen in Exodus. Israel had just been given the second commandment and they immediately broke it. A few chapters later, Aaron and Israel sought to worship God through the form of a golden calf. 'This is your god, O Israel, that brought you out of the land of Egypt' (Exod. 32:4).

We are to note that they still called the image 'Israel's God, the one who delivered them,' but they sought to worship Him through the form of a calf. Moses condemned this act as idolatry. Later in Israel's history, Jeroboam II also used the golden calf to seduce Israel away from temple worship (1 Kings 12:28ff).   Why they used the image of a calf is unclear, but both the calf and bull represented power and strength.

The commandment also prevents us from worshiping other gods with the true God. King Solomon sinned by allowing his wives to introduce idols alongside the worship of the true God in Israel. The practice corrupted Solomon's witness and brought judgment upon him and Israel. it is a warning against syncretism.

Today the Roman Catholic Church adds the worship of Mary and the saints, arguing that both of these can help us in approaching God. They defend their use of images by arguing that worship can be divided into latria and dulia. Latria in Latin is veneration, a lower form of worship. This they claim is acceptable. They say that dulia is worship that belongs to God alone and so idols are prohibited. This is an artificial man-made distinction that breaks the commandment.

In worship the Catholic church also allow syncretism, which is a mixing of Christianity and local religions, in their mission work. In Africa, ancestor worship is included into Catholic doctrine by linking the ancestors to the saints and allowing for the ancestors to assist worship like the saints do for Catholics. In the West, we can introduce worldly cultural things, music and dance, to draw people into the church. The true worship of God then gets mixed with earthly things. Super Bowl Sundays and free car giveaways for attendance are used to get people into church. Worship is turned into entertainment. The culture then enters the church as a form of worship.

In the Exodus narrative, God warns Israel of introducing cultural aspects into worship. In Deuteronomy 12:29-32 He states:  'When the LORD your God cuts off from before you the nations which you go to dispossess, and you displace them and dwell in their land, (30) take heed to yourself that you are not ensnared to follow them, after they are destroyed from before you, and that you do not inquire after their Gods, saying, 'How did these nations serve their Gods? I also will do likewise.' (31) You shall not worship the LORD your God in that way; for every abomination to the LORD which He hates they have done to their gods; for they burn even their sons and daughters in the fire to their gods. (32) Whatever I command you, be careful to observe it; you shall not add to it nor take away from it.'

God warns the church against including other things within its worship or worshiping God in any other way than the way He has commanded. In verse 32 of Deuteronomy 12, God warns Israel not to add anything to His worship or not to take anything away. God has told us how He is to be worshiped and we must follow Him.  

What about pictures of Jesus? Can we make an image of Jesus since Jesus Christ has come in human form we can now make images of Christ and use them to aid worship.  Since Jesus has come in the flesh, of this creation, and he is no longer just Spirit, we can say the second commandment is over. We reject this argument for the following reasons:  

1. Even if Jesus has come, the command not to worship God through any image still stands. Jesus did not revoke it.

2.The argument is reinforced as the Scriptures never once try to describe Jesus' human nature (i.e. what He looked like). Although Peter and the other apostles were all eyewitnesses, they never left one description of the physical Jesus. The Holy Spirit, who guided them in writing the Scriptures, deliberately omitted any description of Jesus. As such the Spirit did not want us to know what He looked like; that was not important and he knew our tendency to make idols. The work of the Spirit in scripture reflects the teaching of the second commandment. The lack of any description means that it is impossible to make an accurate picture. Our best guesses are only conjecture, and they will lead us into error. They have no value.

3. Paul also warns the church about focusing on Jesus according to the flesh. Paul says, 'From now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him thus no longer,' (2 Cor. 5:16). Christ is in His new resurrection body, no longer in the flesh (1 Cor. 15:39). He now has a spiritual body (1 Cor.15:44). As Paul says: It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. His resurrection body is both similar to and yet very different from his natural body. We do not know the exact nature of that body, so it is best to ve careful and not try to make any representation of it.

4. Many like to use representations of God and Jesus for education or evangelistic purposes. They argue we are not worshiping Jesus; rather, we are using the image as an educational tool. This argument is similar to the catholic latria and dulia distinction mentioned above. This distinction cannot be sustained. Education leads to worship; it cannot be separated from it. Due to this link, pictures of Jesus should not be used as educational or evangelistic tools because they cannot be used as aides in worship. True worship is only in and through the power of the Spirit, as we will see in John 4 below.
2.3. Serious Nature of the Commandment
For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, (6) but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments (Exod. 20:5,6).

The serious nature is seen in the second half of the commandment, which stresses God's judgment upon not only those who break the commandment, but also on their children. God says we are not to use images as He is a jealous God. The use of the word 'jealous' points us to covenantal marriage language. In the covenant, the husband is jealous for his wife. In the same way, God is jealous for His glory. No image can do God justice, and all images will take from His glory. they will distort the true worship of God. When we worship idols or worship God through idols, we are breaking the covenantal marriage vow.

God warns that His judgment will fall upon them and their children, even to the third and fourth generation. If we do not worship God seriously, and if we introduce things not commanded in worship, we run the risk of losing future generations through our teaching because God, Himself, will give them over to false worship. We see this in the book of Kings. Wicked kings lead the nation astray and they quickly went into idolatry.  False worship can destroy the next generations of the church.

Israel's worship is confirmed with the covenantal sealing in blood. In Exodus 24:3-8 the Old Covenant is sealed with blood and a sacrifice.  So Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD and all the judgments. And all the people answered with one voice and said, 'All the words which the LORD has said we will do.' (4) And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD. And he rose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of Israel. (5) Then he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the LORD. (6)  And Moses took half the blood and put it in basins, and half the blood he sprinkled on the altar. (7) Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read in the hearing of the people. And they said, 'All that the LORD has said we will do, and be obedient.' (8) And Moses took the blood, sprinkled it on the people, and said; 'This is the blood of the covenant which the LORD has made with you according to all these words.'

The blood of the covenant represents a promise to obey God even unto death. The blood symbolizes judgment if the covenant is breached.

In summary, the worship on Mount Sinai was characterized by:
1. God telling Israel how to approach Him.
2. God revealing Himself in power and great terror.
3. God not showing Israel what he looked like
3. Moses mediating between God and man.
4. God giving express instructions to Moses/Israel on how to worship
5. God ratifying the covenant with blood.

2.4. No Images as God is Spirit
The reason for not worshiping God by any image, as mentioned at Sanai and the second commandment, is made confirmed and clarified in John 4. (We will discuss this passage later.) Jesus tells us that God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth. In Romans 1:20, Paul states 'For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead.'  As Spirit, He has no fleshly or material image, therefore to worship Him through any fleshly, material, and created image is to distort His nature. Those who do so are idolaters, Romans 1:18ff and Acts 17:16-32. Such worship confuses the created world with the uncreated sovereign, eternal Being: 'and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things (Rom. 1:23).
3. The Worship at the Temple
After the fall, God gave Israel the temple. The original worship in the Garden of Eden, is now replaced one place, the temple in the midst of Israel. Only here will God would come down and dwell with men (1 Kings 8). In the glory cloud, God came and dwelt in the tabernacle with His people. The temple, in the midst of Israel, was to teach the people of God two things:

i.  That God dwelt with them, though at the same time,

ii. They were not worthy to enter into His presence due to their sin. A sacrifice was necessary or they would die. Both of these lessons point forward to the coming of Jesus, Emanuel, God with us, who would also give His life as an atonement for sin, so that men can dwell with God. This temple should be understood as pointing backward to the garden and forward to the new heavens and the earth.

4.  Synagogue Worship  

The exile ended temple worship. Even though the temple was rebuilt in the return, the glory of God never returned to it. The local synagogue replaced the temple throughout Israel and in the world wherever the Jews went. A synagogue service was simple: reading, praying and singing. Jesus regularly attended synagogue worship and taught there as well (Luke 4:16ff).  Jesus worshiped in the synagogue and so  many reformed Christians argue that we no longer follow the temple liturgy but should follow the liturgy of the synagogue.  
5. New Covenant Worship
In His coming, Christ, the antitype, fulfilled the Old Covenant types and shadows. In Jesus, as the mediator of the New Covenant, the worship of God reaches its fulfillment. In the second man, the last Adam the garden temple of God is finally built and he extends the temple worship over all the earth. In the New Covenant, worship is no longer focused upon the temple and sacrifices; instead, worship is focused upon the Father, through Christ, and must be in the Spirit and truth.
4.1.	Jesus, the second man, the last Adam
In the second man, the last Adam the garden temple of God is finally built and he extends the garden-temple worship over all the earth. In his own body he does all that the temple did, He is the temple, the meeting place between God and man and he is the sacrifice allowing us to approach into God's presence. In union with his own, and in pouring out his spirit on his own, all in him become the temple of the Holy Spirit. As the temple they are to go out over all the earth, as a royal nation and a holy priesthood, ministering to God and to the nations (Rom 15:
4.1. Jesus is the true Temple
As we have seen, the temple was a shadow and a type pointing forward to Christ in His priestly office and sacrifice. Jesus is the temple and He replaces it. In John 2, He states: 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.' (20) Then the Jews said, 'It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?' (21) But He was speaking of the temple of His body. (22) Therefore, when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said (19-22).

Jesus indicates that He is the true temple and His coming replaces the Old Covenant temple structure. He has come to dwell with his people and all worship is to be centered upon Him. After his mediatorial work is complete, there is no longer any value in any earthly temple or sacrifices. Even under the old testament they could never take away sin (Heb. 10:1-4). Jesus is now the high priest, the sacrifices and the temple itself. In His death the temple veil is torn in two, the sign of the temple given to Israel is finished, as God's new temple is the whole of the new creation in Christ.
4.2. Worship in Spirit and Truth (John 4:4)
Jesus' incarnation and the New Covenant/the new creation, redefined the nature of worship. Jesus describes these changes to the Samaritan woman in John 4:22-24.

You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. (23) But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. (24) God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.'

Jesus tells the woman that the location of worship, currently only at the temple in Jerusalem, will  would shortly become irrelevant. He stresses the need to worship in Spirit and truth and speaks of the need to worship God as Father. The changes occur due to His work, in him finally being lifted up in death (the reference to the hour is a reference to His death and resurrection). The greater promises and benefits under the New Covenant allow for a greater, more intimate, more spiritual worship.
4.2.1. The Background to John 4
During His ministry, Jesus passes through Samaria. The Samaritans believed that they should worship on Mount Gerizim, where Israel initially covenanted with God when they entered the land. Jesus met the woman at the well and answers her question about the correct mountain on which to worship.
4.2.2. Worship Redefined in the New Covenant
Jesus defines New Covenant worship. Under the New Covenant we can now approach God as Father. In order to approach, we must do so in and by the Holy Spirit. It is Jesus' life and death that makes this possible. John 4 stresses the Trinitarian nature of worship. It is worship to the Father, by the works of the Son, aided by the Holy Spirit. Anything other than this is to worship God in vain.  Paul stresses the triune nature of worship in 2 Corinthians 13:14 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.'

Our worship is only valid through Christ as Mediator. Jesus begins by saying that the hour is coming, and now is. The term hour in John's gospel points to His life, death. and resurrection. Jesus, His mediation and His sacrifice, is the basis for all true worship. Wherever men are they can worship God in and through the risen Christ. Jesus says later, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me' (John 14:6). We can only approach God in and through Christ. To approach God in any other way is unacceptable. This mirrors the Old Testament commandments that meant God could only be approached through the temple in Israel.

Jesus says the Father is seeking such to worship Him. Worship is the great objective of salvation. In worship, we are to approach God as Father. Typologically, God called Himself Israel's Father in Exodus 4:22. The typology finds its fulfillment in the Gospels, in the relationship between Jesus and His Father. Since we are in Him, we too address God as Father.

God has many names, and we can use any of the names to address Him, but God has specifically chosen the term 'Father' to define our New Covenant relationship. Jesus says 'the Father' is seeking those to worship Him. It is the height of worship to approach God as a son to his Father. Jesus calls God Father and Holy Father (John 17:1,17), and in the Lord's Prayer, He teaches us to address God as Father (Matt. 6:8). Jesus is the model for sons coming to the Father and we are sons in Him by adoption (Gal 4,5,6).  The father/son relationship indicates the direct, immediate, intimate, and accepted nature of the relationship and worship.

To call or to address God as Father is to join Christ in the Father-Son relationship. In this worship, we have direct access into the Father's presence both through the Son and as the Son had. We approach as coheirs, joint sons with our Elder Brother (Heb. 2:12). We share in the Spirit. Our worship is acceptable in the Son. We may come in Christ, knowing He will receive us. We may come knowing that His Son's sacrifice is acceptable, and so we are accepted as sons.

We are to worship in the Spirit. When Jesus mentions we are to worship in the spirit, He does not mean we are to worship Him from our hearts or our inner beings. John's reference to the spirit draws on the fact that God is Spirit. Jesus says, 'God is Spirit' (John 4:24). Sinful fleshly men can only worship God as a spiritual, holy being if they are first regenerated and then aided by the Spirit. In John 3, Jesus tells Nicodemus that he must be born again through the Spirit of God to enter the Kingdom. In Isaiah 31:3, God contrasts the flesh and the Spirit of God. Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; And their horses are flesh, and not spirit. In Ezekiel 11:19, 36:26, God promises to put His Spirit within true worshipers in the New Covenant.  Then I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them, and take the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh'(Ezek. 11:19).

I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh (Ezek. 36:26).

The unregenerate cannot worship God. To worship in the spirit is to worship with a regenerate heart, being indwelt by the person of the Spirit. It cannot be done in the flesh. The unregenerate man cannot worship God. True spiritual worship is a work of the Holy Spirit in our souls. Because worship is now 'in the Spirit', it does not rely upon any of the external fleshly ordinances. Outward things, the Temple, sacrifices, and feast days are no longer relevant.  

We see the centrality of the Spirit for all Christian actions in that it is the Spirit that reveals the truth to us. It is He who changes the heart, and it is He who indwells us, making us the New Temple of God.

We are to worship in truth. This has two aspects. In the immediate context, it refers to the need to worship God according to His revealed will that he had given to Israel. The Samaritans  failed to worship God because they failed to worship Him as He had revealed Himself.   Incorrect worship, worship not according to truth, is false worship. If we do not worship God in truth, we do not worship Him at all. Our worship will be rejected. In the broader context, the word 'truth' must be read in the light of the rest of the Scriptures and the New Covenant. This refers to worshiping Him as the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
5.  Church Worship
In the new covenant, all those who are indwelt by Christ at now a living temple. Paul says to the Corinthians:

16 What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said, 'I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. (2 Cor.6:16,17)

In same way Peter says:

'' you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ'. 9 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
Believers re living stones in the temple of God and they offer spiritual sacrifices unto God.
In corporate worship the church also draws near in a new way in the new testament. the shadows of the Old Testament have passed away and the fullness of worship has come in the church of Christ, indwelt by the Spirit. We see this in two great parallel passages, in  Hebrews 12 and Revelation 4,5.

In Hebrews 12, the author contrasts worship under the Old Covenant with the greater worship in the New Covenant. In the Old Testament the church approach God as she did at Mount Sinai,  but now, the Church enters into God's presence in a direct manner.

For you have not come to what may be touched, a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest and (19) the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them. (20) For they could not endure the order that was given, 'If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.'  (21) Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, 'I tremble with fear.' (22) But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, (23) to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are registered in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect, (24) to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel (Heb. 12:18-24).

In contrast to the frightening spectacle in Moses' day, believers are encouraged to enter God's presence. In worship, the church enters into God's heavenly presence. Believers are in the company of the living God, the Judge of all. They are present in the heavenly Jerusalem, the true dwelling place of God.  They stand with Jesus, the Mediator of the New Covenant, sanctified by His blood and His work. They join with the angels and the saints in heaven.  

In revelation John also speaks about the current nature of heavenly New Covenant worship. John was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, and he was taken into heaven (Rev. 1:10). He enters the very throne room of God and sees a vision of the Ancient of Days upon the throne and the Lamb that was slain standing next to Him. The Holy Spirit is also surrounding the throne (Rev. 4:5). God and the Lamb are in the center of the throne surrounded by the angels and the church worshiping. They worship God for His works of creation and redemption (Rev. 4,5). In both of these passages we see the same principle of worship, angels, coming into the throne of God, and those who died in Christ have gone before. In New testament worship the believer actual enters in the this very presence. It is not a metaphor or a slimily, it is a reality. the local church on earth joins the heavenly church, the angels and enters into the heavenly realm, and the very presence of Christ.  We will explore this in more depth in the next lesson.

As great as this is, it is not the final picture of worship in the Scriptures. In revelation we see the great gathered community of God people

6. Future Heavenly Worship

The Bible ends with pictures of worship in the New Heavens and the New Earth (Rev. 20-22). In these verses, we see the coming of the New Heaven and the New Earth. Jerusalem, the city of God, descends upon the New Earth. Jerusalem is the center of the worship of God. In the New Creation, there is no temple. The Lamb is the temple, and likewise the church is the temple along with the whole of the New Creation.  In the New Creation, the separation between God and man is ended. The Fatherhood of God is complete, and we will stand with Christ in the Spirit before God forever.

Conclusion

The Bible teaches about worship from type to antitype. In the second commandment, God forbids the making and worshiping of any graven images.  In the New Covenant, Jesus tells us that God is Spirit, and if we are to worship Him we are to worship in Spirit and truth. Our New Testament worship is heavenly worship; we enter into heaven itself in Christ and in Christ join the heavenly community. The Scriptures end with the whole of the New Heavens and the New Earth being the temple.
