# 2: A Biblical Theology of Worship Handout

## Review

Last week we looked at various answers to the question **"What is the point of Sunday Worship?"** Today we'll begin to work on an answer to this question.

Worship is hard to define crisply. This is because it's connected to our theology and anthropology. The Westminster Catechism's first question sums this up well:

>Q. What is the chief end of man?</br>
>A. Man's chief end is to **glorify God**, and to **enjoy** him forever.

Man's chief end is twofold, and the errors we cover last week tend to emphasize one half at the expense of the other. A good theology of worship will include both halves.

### What is the Point of Sunday Worship?

_Exercise: We ended last week with an assignment to come up with our own answers to this question. What did you decide?_

##  Definitions

<!-- ASK: How would you define worship? -->

**English**:</br>
_worship_, from _weorth + scipe_. Worthiness; to ascribe worth.

**Hebrew**:</br>
_cagad, shachah._ To prostrate oneself, to prostrate in homage.

**Greek:** </br>
_proskuneo, 54 usages._ To prostrate oneself. One of the more common words for worship in the NT, and the word used in the key passage of the woman at the well ([John 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+4&version=NASB)). </br>
_latreuo, 21 usages_; To serve or worship, as in the work of a priest, used in [Romans 12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12&version=NASB).</br>
_eusebeo, 2 usages;_ To honor or worship. Used by Paul at Mars Hill ([Acts 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+17&version=NASB)).

We need to be careful when we talk about worship to define what we mean. Our English word doesn't represent the originals well, and we're usually importing extra context that can muddy our exegesis.

## Worship as Covenant Renewal

One way to think of worship, and the pattern we'll be using in this course, is that worship is **Covenant Renewal**. As a topic, it includes or influences many other topics we'll consider this term:

1. Covenant defines the relationship between God and man. If worship flows from the doctrines of God and man, covenant is unavoidable in the discussion.
2. The Levitical code is some of the most explicit worship teaching in the Bible. How we apply it today relies heavily on how we understand the Old and New covenants.
3. Temple imagery is often connected to worship in the New Testament. Covenantal thinking helps us trace how this idea develops.
4. What you believe about the sacraments, a key element of worship, is a consequence of what you believe about the covenants.

In the next two weeks, we'll be using two other big brooms: temple and sabbath. Neither do quite as much for us as covenant, however.

### A Pattern for Defining Covenants

Covenants come in many shapes and sizes. In the ancient period, covenants were how relationships were formalized. Individuals would covenant in marriage, to define business relationships, or to formalize oaths. Rulers would also covenant with their people; covenants like these were basically ancient constitutions. God used this well-known pattern to communicate to His people.

Because covenant formalized relationships, and because no two relationships are really the same, covenants don't follow a strict pattern. Still, we may observe the following general patterns in the Bible:

1. God initiates, **taking hold** of something.
2. God **separates** and makes **something new**.
3. God **speaks**, stipulating the covenant.
4. God provides **signs** and **seals** of the covenant.
5. God arranges for the **future**.

We don't have time to walk through all five generally recognized covenants today. Let's do three.

### The Covenant of Works

This is God's first covenant, with Adam. This is not an explicit covenant but is still widely recognized to be one. 

_Exercise: Write down how the pattern above can be seen in [Genesis 2](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/genesis/2.shtml):_

1. How does God initiate or **take hold**?
<!-- God takes hold of the earth he has created. -->
<br />
<br />

2. What does God **separate**? What **new thing** does he make?
<!-- He separates dust from dust and breathes life into the dust. -->
<br />
<br />

3. What does God **speak**? What does he stipulate?
<!-- He puts Adam into the garden to cultivate and keep it, and tells him not to eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. -->
<br />
<br />

4. What are the **signs**, **seals**, or **rituals** of this covenant?
<!-- The two trees, a meal, representing life of obedience and death of disobedience. -->
<br />
<br />

5. How does God arrange for the **future** succession of this covenant?
<!-- He creates Eve and gives them an additional blessing. -->
<br />
<br />

### The Mosaic Covenant

This is the most detailed covenant in the Bible, and one we'll be considering in depth in future weeks. It will be helpful to have these categories in mind as we study.

_Exercise: Write down how the pattern above can be seen in the Sinai narrative, especially the last half of Exodus and Leviticus._

1. How does God initiate or **take hold**?
<!-- He takes hold of his people in slavery and bondage. -->
<br />
<br />

2. What does God **separate**? What **new** **thing** does he make?
<!-- He separates them from Egypt, separates the Red Sea, gives them a new name (Israel), gives himself a new name (Yahweh). -->
<br />
<br />

3. What does God **speak**? What does he stipulate?
<!-- The law, obvs. -->
<br />
<br />

4. What are the **signs**, **seals**, or **rituals** of this covenant?
<!-- Tabernacle, priesthood, Levitical system, Passover. -->
<br />
<br />

5. How does God arrange for the **future** succession of this covenant?
<!-- Deut 32-34, the blessings and curses. -->
<br />
<br />

### The New Covenant

Finally, we'll consider how this all works in the New Covenant. 

_Exercise: Write down how this pattern fits the New Covenant. Also think about major parts of Bethel's worship service and write down where you think they go._

1. How does God initiate or **take hold**?
<!-- He takes on human flesh. -->
<br />
<br />

2. What does God **separate**? What **new** **thing** does he make?
<!-- Jesus suffers the separation of death, but becomes the New Adam and a new King. -->
<br />
<br />

3. What does God **speak**? What does he stipulate?
<!-- The whole New Testament, basically. Also, "love one another." -->
<br />
<br />

4. What are the **signs**, **seals**, or **rituals** of this covenant?
<!-- Baptism, The Lord's Supper. -->
<br />
<br />

5. How does God arrange for the **future** succession of this covenant?
<!-- The Great Commission. -->
<br />
<br />
