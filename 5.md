## Review

Last week we traced the themes of **seven** and **sabbath** in the pre-Exodus period.

1. **Seven**, the number of completeness, is used as a literary device throughout the Bible, especially the first few chapters. It has the same letters (שבע) as the word _complete_ and is often punned with the word _shabbat_ (rest / oath).
2. The **rest** of the Garden comes from God's completed work. Mankind was the last work of God and _rested_ into the Garden and a neverending Sabbath.
3. Two characteristics of this rest are **peace** and **plenty**.
4. The Fall disrupted the right relationships in God's good creation. This resulted in **enmity** and **scarcity**.

We traced these themes as they develop in the Bible.

1. Cain's murder, and his murderous descendants, underscore the **enmity** between man and his neighbor.
2. Noah is a bright spot; his name means _rest_ (_Noakh_, from _nuakh_) and his father Lamech prophesies that Noah will bring rest from our toil. He plants a vineyard (good), gets drunk (not good), Ham is cursed (definitely bad).
3. After the initial blessings of creation up to Abraham, Genesis mentions curses 7 times and blessings only 3.
4. Abraham's story reverses this pattern. Blessing is used 81 times and far outweighs curses through the end of Genesis.
5. God covenants with Abraham and says that he will receive **descendants**, a **land**, and that through him all nations will be **blessed**.

The pattern of the creation week gains new meaning at Sinai.

1. God tells Israel to pattern their work and rest routines after the creation week.
2. Many Biblical stories follow a decreation/recreation pattern. The flood is one such example. The Exodus is another.
3. God's people are recreated into a world of scarcity and enmity. Sabbath is a discipline which remembers God's promises to eventually restore Eden. It is easy for us to labor under the curse and forget that we are not masters of our own time or creation — God is our ultimate source of provision. Sabbath is a disciplined remembrance of this fact.

This is where we left off, and we'll continue developing these themes this week.

## Sabbath Laws

We are probably familiar with the Sabbath law given in the Ten Commandments. There are other Sabbath commands that underscore the connection of this practice to Eden.

### Manna

The first sabbath command is in Exodus 16, before Sinai, when God brings bread to his people in the wilderness. They are told to collect double manna on the sixth day and no manna on the seventh. Though manna would normally rot during the night, it did not on the seventh day, a picture of Eden **plenty**. God commanded that a jar of manna be put into the Ark of the Covenant, and it presumably did not rot, intensifying this symbol. Remember that the Ark also contained a budding rod and God's Ten Words. God's throne pictures for us a completed Eden.

### Sabbath and Release

In Deuteronomy, when God restates the purpose for Sabbath, a new reason is added: Israel were once slaves in Egypt, and Sabbath should be a picture of rest from slavery. Israel was to give their servants and their animals rest as well. This is a picture of **peace** that is built upon substantially in Sabbath law.

### The Year of Release

<!-- Primary passage is Leviticus 25. -->

Every seventh year, there was a Sabbath year — _Shmita_, literally "release" — where Israel was to release debts and debt slaves. "There will be no poor among you, since the LORD will surely bless you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess." The commandment goes on to warn Israel that they should not harden their hearts and try to game the system. Even in the sixth year, they were to lend freely.

The year of release was also a time when Israel was to leave their fields fallow and give the **land** rest ([Leviticus 25](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/leviticus/25.shtml)). What grew belonged to everybody to pick and eat freely, even livestock, just like the Garden of Eden.

### Jubilee

Every 50th year, Jubilee was declared. It was a total economic reset: debts were released and land was fallowed as in the year of release, but importantly, land ownership was also restored. The Fall creates calamity and poverty and loss, and over the course of a generation a family might lose their inheritance. Every Jubilee, Israel was completely restored to their original state when they entered the land.

### Entering the Land

Psalm 95 says that the Promised Land is God's Rest for Israel. After 40 years — another important number — wandering in the wilderness, Israel entered a land of **milk** and **honey**. The Amorites' sin was now complete, and God promised to cleanse the land of its wickedness using Israel. Jericho is a picture of how this cleansing should have happened.

Israel was given rest in this new land, full of plenty, and charged to be faithful to God's law. If they obeyed, God promised to multiply and prosper Israel as a nation of priests.

We will pick up this theme later when we look at Hebrews.

### A Brief Word on Solomon

The image of plenty in the Garden was an enduring image for Israel. Near the beginning of Solomon's reign, we read in [1 Kings 6](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/1_kings/6.shtml) that "...Judah and Israel lived in safety, every man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon."

When Israel had a wise king, he restored Eden to the people. They lived in peace and plenty.

## The Lord of the Sabbath

Jesus deals extensively with Sabbath during his ministry. A key to understanding his teaching is that he is not reinterpreting Sabbath, but rather fulfilling it.

1. In the Gospels, Jesus is baptized in the Jordan river, and driven out into the wilderness for 40 days. John's exhortation to the people in Luke (3:11) emphasizes sharing and Jubilee themes.
2. When Jesus announces his ministry in [Luke 4](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/luke/4.shtml), he uses Shmita to do so. It is common to over-spiritualize this passage, but actual release and healing is clearly in view.
3. In [Matthew 11](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/matthew/11.shtml) (14, 28-30) and again in [Matthew 12](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/matthew/12.shtml), Jesus teaches about Sabbath. He teaches that his yoke (a significant word to Jews) is light. His disciples pick grain freely as if they're in a garden.
4. Jesus' resurrection occurs on the first day of a new week. Pentecost, which happens seven weeks and one day after Passover Sabbath, is when he sends his spirit.

## New Testament Teaching

The Fall resulted in mankind being driven out of the **peace** and **plenty** of the Garden. God promised Abraham that he would restore this original blessing, and the history and rites of Israel remember this promise. These rites were shadows of the ultimate Sabbath rest which arrives in Jesus.

We live in the New Covenant, and Jesus the Messiah has brought us this rest and a new creation. We live in a New Creation, with **peace** and **plenty** restored to us. Yet work is still cursed, and we do not have peace with our neighbors. Like much of New Covenant reality, there we are heirs to an already-not-yet promise. How are we to live in light of this new reality?

1. In Hebrews 3-4, we learn that we are to consider Israel's unbelief in the wilderness a warning in our own day. God's rest is still something we must **enter**, and not everybody has entered it. Through unbelief, it is possible to not enter God's rest.
2. In Romans 14:5, Paul includes Sabbath observance in his teaching about weaker and stronger brothers. For Paul, observing Sabbath was not as important as the law of love.
3. In Colossians 2:18, Paul specifically mentions the Jewish festal calendar. He calls them shadows of **what is to come**, and tells us to hold fast to Christ.

## Takeaways

In future weeks, we'll unpack how the church applies these teaching today. For now, consider how Sabbath is fulfilled in Jesus:

1. Why might one still wish to practice Sabbath in the New Covenant?
2. How do the sacraments of baptism and the Eucharist connect to **rest**? How about the themes of **peace** and **plenty**?
3. Do we still live in a world of scarcity? How should we live as people who believe in God's abundance? Consider Acts and 2 Corinthians for ideas.
