# 1: Introduction

## Summary

> By the grace of God, Bethel exists as a church for Lake Charles and its surrounding communities where God’s worship and Word defines us, His Spirit changes us, and the Gospel of Jesus compels us.

We're starting in on a series that unpacks some key sections of Bethel's mission statement. The first thing we'll be covering is **"God's worship ... defines us."**

This week, we introduce the concept of worship broadly. We talk a bit about why we come to church on Sunday, and why we do the things we do while we're there.

## A Caution

Worship, particularly liturgy, has been a divisive topic throughout church history. This is true also of the PCA. The PCA is a remarkably diverse denomination, and worship style has been a topic of some interest and concern for decades. Notably, among major presbyterian denominations the PCA has one of the loosest worship directories. In 1975, the PCA decided that their directory would not carry for the force of law, leaving many of the particulars of worship to individual sessions. Freedom in worship is intended to be a feature, not a bug, of the PCA.

The Reformers and many conservative presbyterians would likely disagree with how Bethel worships. Many here would probably disagree with their positions.

Approaching this topic with a humble, teachable spirit is especially important for Bethel today. Our next pastor may have very different ideas of worship. While we study this topic, we should consider multiple viewpoints and consider them charitably. I will make a point of representing multiple viewpoints throughout. Discussion is encouraged; we must also be careful to maintain the cheerful spirit of diversity that distinguishes the PCA.

## Term Overview

The term will be split into three broad chunks:

1. A Biblical Theology of worship
2. A Systematic Theology of worship
3. Practical and historical applications of these theologies

Biblical Theology attempts to tell the story of the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus. Systematic theology attempts to summarize all the Bible has to say about a certain topic. These two taken together inform how we apply the Bible's teaching to our own circumstances.

Generally, this is the flow of biblical interpretation in general. Biblical theology helps situate our exegesis, systematic theology helps us relate all Biblical data coherently, and then application follows that hard work.

## Why are we here?

_Question: What is the point of Sunday Worship? Why are we here?_

How you answer this question has a significant influence on worship. Consider how you'd put together a worship service given the following answers:

1. Sunday Worship is for evangelism.
2. Sunday Worship is for the education of the church.
3. Sunday Worship is meant to encourage and build up the church.
4. Sunday Worship is for the praise and exaltation of God.

_Exercise: Write down some thoughts about how these emphases would impact how you would design a worship service. Example: if I wanted the most people possible to accept Christ at the end of the service, how might I preach? What would the music sound like?_

## What are we doing? Why are we doing it?

_Exercise: Write down some major sections of our worship service. Then, think about how specifically we do it. Then, ask why we do it that way. Example: Opening hymn. Mr. Rick plays flute._

Take some time to list out the things we do during worship every Sunday. After that, think through why we do them and write down some brief reasons. Don't worry about providing chapter and verse, or any biblical argument at all if you can't come up with one.

## Common Errors

The answers above all represent common errors in the contemporary church.

### Sunday Worship is for Evangelism

Many modern churches — megachurches, emergent churches, many Community and non-denominational churches — commit this error to some degree. Worship is something you do before God, and evangelism is something you do before people. Making worship about evangelism leads to an emphasis on _technique_ and _results_. This emphasis orders the service around appeal and comfort — with man at the center — rather than God's directions for how He wants to be approached.

### Sunday Worship is for Education

This is a common emphasis mistake in Reformed churches, where the sermon is the main event and other elements merely support it. Interestingly, the Bible does not emphasize teaching in worship much at all. When God's throne is pictured, we do not see a sermon. We see singing, prostration, sacrifices, and meals. This is not to say that teaching has no place in worship, but it should be put it its proper place.

### Sunday Worship as Experience

This error goes hand-in-hand with evangelism as an emphasis. Rather than focusing on results for the lost, instead the focus is on an emotional experience for Christians. This places man — and his particular cultural preferences — at the center of worship rather than God. Music is selected for its ability to move the congregation. Sermons focus less on theological rigor and tend to self-help sound bytes.

### Sunday Worship is for Exaltation

This is much closer to a good definition, but still falls short. We need to think of _prostration_ to understand the error here. Prostration is a posture that places the worshipper at the mercy of God, in his proper place. It prepares the worshipper to be _lifted up_ and _served_ by God. If the other three errors over-emphasize the worshipper, this error over-emphasizes the object of worship. Worship is two-sided. God receives our worship; we receive His grace. Put another way: if worship is for exaltation, what place does the Eucharist have in our service?
