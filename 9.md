# 9: The Elements of Worship

We're working on what it looks like to build a worship service from scratch.

This week we will learn about **The Elements** of worship: the substantial pieces of worship with clear Biblical evidence that we believe should be included in every worship service. We will map these elements back onto our corporate worship service and consider how they may be reinforced in family worship.

Our takeaway this week is that worship is about hearing from God, responding to Him, and communing with Him through the signs and seals He has given us. Our Christian lives should be ordered around practicing and perfecting these skills.

## Review

Last week we introduced a very practical but historically difficult question: starting from scratch, how would we design a worship service? What should we do, and what shouldn't we do? How should we do it? What should we look to as a starting point?

This is a question about authority, and throughout church history we've seen three kinds of answers:

1. **The Inventive Principle**: The church is free to make its own decisions about worship.
2. **The Normative Principle**: Whatever is not forbidden in Scripture is permitted in worship so long as it promotes peace and unity. We look to Scripture for patterns that help us decide how to do this.
3. **The Regulative Principle**: Whatever is not expressly permitted in Scripture is forbidden in worship. Specifically, we're looking for three things that constitute "permission": express commands, approved examples, and theological inferences.

We reviewed the history of the **Regulative Principle** as a reaction to Anglo-Catholic liturgies, and also how difficult it has proven to apply consistently — it is a good principle but must be applied carefully and with humility. A risk of the **Regulative Principle** is that when one presses inference _too far_, requiring of men what God does not, one ironically commits the very error the principle was designed to correct. 

I suggested an understanding of the principle that comes from the Reformer Martin Bucer: "Nothing should be introduced or performed in the churches of Christ for which no probable reason can be given from the Word of God."

We also discussed how these three historic principles are not at odds with one another, but are actually all being applied in any practical decision about worship. What is important is how we **order** the principles: 

1. Start with the **Regulative Principle** to determine the substance, or big picture, of what we should be doing. 
2. Use the **Normative Principle** to fill in important details (order, style) about a particular element by using patterns we find in the Bible.
3. Use the **Inventive Principle** for any remaining details.

Different Reformed traditions draw these lines in different places, and a great deal of the diversity in the PCA can be explained by diversity in how churches understand where one principle stops and another begins.

## The Elements of Worship

Now that we have some principles in mind, we'll get to work building a worship service.

A first question we might ask is "What should we do? What shouldn't we do?" Using **The Regulative Principle**, the WCF describes the basic parts of a worship service — **The Elements** — that a public Christian worship service should contain. We'll spend the rest of the week looking at those elements.

A general distinction between **Elements,** **Forms**, and **Circumstances** is made in Reformed tradition and in the WCF in particular. This distinction is not explicit in Scripture, it is purely systematic, and there is wide disagreement about the definitions and boundaries of these terms. For our purposes, we'll map these categories back onto our **Principles**: **Elements** are those broad categories of worship activity that have excellent Biblical warrant; **Forms** are the patterns we might follow to arrange those elements; and **Circumstances** are what happen when we put those **Elements** to practice with particular people in particular places — what time to meet, what things to wear, what kind of building to meet in, &c.

WCF 21 gives us the outline of the **Elements** to which we adhere in the PCA.

1. **Prayer, with thanksgiving**, being one special part of religious worship ([Phil 4:6](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/philippians/4.shtml), [1 Tim 2:1](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/1_timothy/2.shtml), [Col 4:2](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/colossians/4.shtml)), is by God required of all men: and, that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the name of the Son, by the help of his Spirit, according to his will, with understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, and perseverance; and, if vocal, in a known tongue ([1 Cor 14:14](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/1_corinthians/14.shtml)). 
2. The **reading of the Scriptures** with godly fear ([Luke 4:16-17](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/luke/4.shtml), [Acts 15:21](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/acts/15.shtml), [Col 4:16](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/colossians/4.shtml)),
3. the **sound preaching** ([2 Tim 4:2](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/2_timothy/4.shtml), [Acts 5:42](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/acts/5.shtml)) and **conscionable hearing** of the Word, in obedience unto God, with understanding, faith, and reverence ([James 1:22](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/james/1.shtml), [Heb 4:2](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/hebrews/5.shtml)),
4. **singing of psalms** with grace in the heart ([Col 3:16](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/colossians/3.shtml));
5. as also, the **due administration and worthy receiving of the sacraments** instituted by Christ, are all parts of the ordinary religious worship of God ([Matt 28:19](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/matthew/28.shtml), [1 Cor 11:23-29](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/1_corinthians/11.shtml), [Acts 2:42](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/acts/2.shtml)): 
6. beside **religious oaths** ([2 Cor 1:23](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/2_corinthians/1.shtml)), **vows**, **solemn fastings** ([Matt 9:15](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/matthew/9.shtml), [Acts 14:23](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/acts/14.shtml)), and **thanksgivings upon special occasions** ([Ex 15:1-21](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/exodus/15.shtml)), which are, in their several times and seasons, to be used in an holy and religious manner ([Heb 12:18](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/hebrews/12.shtml)).

Though the WCF omits it, widespread practice includes the collection of tithes and offerings as a part of worship ([1 Cor 16:1-2](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/1_corinthians/16.shtml)).

We may summarize the elements of worship as hearing from God through his **word**, responding to God in **prayers**, **songs**, **vows**, and **offerings**, and communing with God through the **sacraments**.

## Covenant Renewal and The Elements

Let's take our pattern from several weeks ago and test to see how **The Elements of Worship** fit into it:

1. God initiates, taking hold of something.
2. God separates and makes something new.
3. God speaks, stipulating the covenant.
4. God provides signs and seals of the covenant.
5. God arranges for the future.

An important component of **The Elements** is congregational participation. Individual and family worship can prepare us and our children for participation.

1. What are we doing to teach our children to pray?
2. How can we help our children practice vows, offerings, and solemn fasts?
3. How are we equipping our children to participate in congregational singing?
4. How can we help our children hear and understand the Word?
5. How can we prepare our children to understand and celebrate the sacraments?
