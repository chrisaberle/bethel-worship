# Lesson One: Introduction to Worship

The lesson is an introduction to worship. Man was created to worship God (Isa. 43:7). Jesus says we are to worship God alone (Matt. 4:10). Jesus tells the woman at the well that the Father is seeking those who will worship Him in Spirit and truth (John 4:21'24). The principle that men are to worship God is found throughout the Scriptures, being mentioned 192 times. This concept includes:
 
1. Personal worship (Rom. 12:1ff), 
2. Family worship, and 
3. Corporate worship, the worship of the church as a community. 

Although we will briefly mention personal and family worship the focus of this course is corporate worship of the New Testament church. The worship of the gathered church is central to the life of the church. The witness of the whole of Scripture is that in being saved we will turn to worship God in every sphere, and particularly in the corporate public worship of God.  This is the thrust of the whole of Scripture. 

## Worship Confusion

There is a great deal of confusion about worship today. One can travel from church to church and from denomination to denomination and experience a wide range of worship styles and philosophies.  No two churches are the same. 

In most cases, when I have asked church leaders why they worship in a particular way, they simply say, that is the way we have always done it and it is the way I have seen it done.  In the list below are some of the common thoughts about worship.  As you read them consider which ones you agree with and which ones you disagree with. How many of these have you thought about?

1. Worship should reflect our culture. We should feel comfortable in worship. 
2. We should show reverence and respect in worship. 
3. Outward elements are not important. What is important is what is in the heart.
4. We use traditional worship. We use contemporary worship. We use a blended worship style. 
5. Worship should be made to make unbelievers feel comfortable. Church is about evangelism. 
6. Our worship should be free, in the Spirit, and therefore should be unconstrained by the human forms. 
7. Our worship must be in truth, so it must follow the Scriptures at all points. 
8. Our worship is according to the tradition of the church. We have always done it this way. 
9. Church worship is not important; what matters is my personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  I can worship God at home. Going to church does nothing for me. 
10. Everybody should share in worship.

The many and varied claims above show that there is a great deal of confusion regarding worship styles, and this reflects a general failure to develop a theology of worship. Today the worship of the church reflects the days of the judges in Israel in which, everyone does what is right in their own eyes (Joshua 21:25).

Others claim that since all of life is worship, there is no difference between our personal devotions and out corporate public worship. in fact there is no need for corporate worship. This is wrong. Private worship, family worship and corporate worship are all slightly different, they occur in different context and with different rules  and focus of this course is cooperate worship. Speaking about the difference between personal and cooperate worship Rayburn notes '.individual Christians ave been encouraged to have their own daily quiet time, for a period of personal devotion is an important part of every Christian's life. They have been admonished to pray for their own needs and the needs of others. They have been taught to study the Bible for their own spiritual growth and for use in guiding and instructing others. There remains, however among sincere believers today a woeful ignorance concerning the significance of true worship and the means of attaining the blessings of a rich, rewarding corporate worship.' (1)

As we travel with MINTS these are the two main errors we see in the church, a confusion to develop clear regarding principles of worship for the church and confusion between personal and corporate public worship. The confusion exists because many have not thought through a biblical, consistent, and theological basis of worship. In this study, we will see that God has given us clear principles for worship. The issue has been discussed I the church for centuries, and at the period of the Reformation the church was forced to rethink the true nature of worship, to develop central principles of worship as it had fallen under attack. It is our job to recover these principles and teach them to the church.

## The Spheres of Worship 
All of life is an act of worship; this includes both private worship (Rom 12:1), family worship  and corporate worship. This principle is found in both the old and the New Testament. 

It is one of the great joys of believers that they can all worship God privately. In the Old Testament David affirms God is everywhere (Ps 139:7). In this sense David was always before god and in his presence, and so always called to worship. In the new testament Jesus commands to pray in secret (Matt ) and Jesus himself often went off to pray on his own, or just with his disciples (Mark 6:31).  On the missionary journeys we also see Paul and Barnibus and others worshiping God and praying alone (Acts 16).

In addition to private worship the scriptures also teaches the vital importance of corporate public worship. In the Old Testament there were specific times when the people of Israel  joined together in worship.  In these times a believer entered into God's presence in a unique way. Psalms 93-100 are worship psalms. In Psalm 100:2 the psalmist invites Israel to 'Serve the Lord with gladness!, Come into his presence with singing! In this psalm the Israelites was told to serve God and to come into God's presence in a unique way. In the battle between Moses and Korah over who had the particular right to minster before God, Moses says: and he said to Korah and all his company, 'In the morning the Lord will show who is his, and who is holy, and will bring him near to him. The one whom he chooses he will bring near to him. 

The unique nature of corporate worship is seen in God's special presence and glory in the presence of his church. God's special presence is seen in His glory, and his name was found in the tabernacle (Ex 40:34-38), and later in Solomon's temples (1 Kings 8:29). At the designated feast, three times a year, the congregation came to Jerusalem to enter into God's presence in a unique way (Ex 23:14,17). As most Israelites would only attend three times a year, they met for weekly corporate Sabbath services according to the 4th commandment, for instruction and worship. The synagogue and temple worship were both aspects of corporate worship. 

In the New Testament Jesus worshiped openly and corporately in the synagogues (an important point that shows Jesus accepted the worship practices of the synagogue) and we see the early church were always together in worship (Acts 1, 2). A quick study of worship in the New Testament shows the vital importance of cooperate public worship. The corporate worship of the gathered church is central to the life of the church. The church gathered on the first day of the week (Acts 20:7) to reflect the day of Jesus resurrection. This practice was vital for church life. The writer to the Hebrew exhorts the church, do not forsake the gathering together as is the manner of some (Heb. 10:25)

## Salvation Leads to Worship 

The witness of the whole of Scripture is that we are saved and as a result the people of God will worship him. In the life of the nation of Israel was redeemed from Egypt and then commanded in order that they might as a nation worship God in the wilderness. This was corporate and public worship, not merely personal and private. 

> Afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh, 'Thus says the LORD God of Israel: 'Let My people go, that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.'' (Exod. 5:1). 

After being redeemed from Egypt, Israel's salvation as the focus of her praise. She is called to serve, worship, and praise Him. In Exodus 15 we read: 

> Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying: 'I will sing to the LORD, For He has triumphed gloriously! The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea! (2)The LORD is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation; He is my God, and I will praise Him; My father's God, and I will exalt Him' (Exod. 15:1,2).

Hart and Muether (52) capture Israel's experience: 'The Israelites rightly responded to their deliverance from the bondage of Egypt with a song of praise to the God of their salvation. Not only did the Exodus elicit a song of worship, but this song of worship also showed that God had delivered His people so they could worship Him.'   

Israel's salvation under Moses points us to the greater salvation of the church through Christ. In John 4, we read how Jesus saved the woman at the well. In teaching her about salvation Jesus says:, 'But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth' (23,24). Jesus joins salvation and worship. Just like Israel's salvation in the Old Covenant, the New Covenant salvation is salvation in order to worship. 

The Scriptures end with the same focus on worship. John is given his Revelation on the Lord's day (Rev 1:10). In Revelation 4 and 5, the twenty-four elders and the multitude that cannot be numbered (the church) worship God for His two great works of creation and salvation. 

> Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, (10) the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: (11) 'You are worthy, O Lord, To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they exist and were created,' (Rev. 4:9-11).

The heavenly church also gives thanks for redemption. And they sang a new song, saying: 'You are worthy to take the scroll, And to open its seals; For You were slain, And have redeemed us to God by Your blood Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, (10) And have made us kings and priests to our God; And we shall reign on the earth' (Rev. 5:9,10).

The end of the salvation of God's elect leads to worship of God. From Israel, to Christ speaking to the woman at the well, the early church in Acts and finally to the very church in heaven, the pattern is the same; the church is saved to worship. God's great aim in salvation is to gather a community to Himself in order to worship Him. 

## The Unique Contribution of Reformed Worship.

Why are we studying Reformed Worship, principles that were developed many years ago? We do so as the Reformers made a unique contribution. At the time of the Reformation the way of worship was broken, and the reformers went back to fix it. We offer the following analogy. I have driven a car for many years, and if you asked me how it worked, in many cases I would not know. It runs and so I have not thought much about it. As my car has gotten older then it has broken down (a lot) and I have been forced to think about the issues that I would not have done so. It has only been once my car is broken, and I have been forced to fix it, that I have really thought about it. 

In the same way, at the time of the Reformation the worship of God was broken, many errors had been brought into the church, and so the church was forced the church to rethink worship, what was wrong with it and how to fix it. in this process they went back to first principles, the true underlying principles in the scripture that teach about worship, salvation and theology.

The issue arose due to the theology and worship of the Roman Catholic Church. In the first 400 years the early church followed a simple service based around the word and the sacraments, Baptism and the Lord Supper. In the middle ages, the church moved away from the simplicity of worship and became more ornate. The major trends included the use of Latin in worship which was not understood by the church.  Originally, the Roman Church used Latin, the contemporary Roman Language understood by all. as the church grew and expanded it went to many areas in which Latin was not understood. As the church becoming formal, her forms of worship and theology, were written down in Latin and they imposed this on all churches everywhere, including those churches that did not speak Latin. Over time, Latin continued to dominate even and so many could not understand worship. The church was now worshiping without understanding. This practice was only formally changed in Second Vatican council, 1962-1965.   In refusing to teach the word the church then began to use visual aids, statues, icons and paintings to aid worship. They took away the word and replaced it with images. In time, the theology of worship was changed. This was seen in the Lord's Supper. The doctrine of the upper room, the Lord's Supper, was changed to that of the Mass. In the doctrine of transubstantiation, the elements of bread and wine were seen to be transformed, changed into the very reality of Christ's body and blood. The priest was literally sacrificing Christ's body and blood. In time the Mass was elevated and made the center of salvation and worship. The focus shifted to the priesthood, who administered the Mass, gained power, and parts of the sacrifice were removed from the people. The laity, the congregation, was passive in worship. 

The interrelationship between salvation and worship in the Roman Catholic church meant that the Reformation was as much about key doctrines of God and salvation as it was about worship. In the Reformation both issue had to be addressed.  

It is into this broken system of Roman Catholic worship that the reformers 'sought to fix the broken car.' They went back to first principles. They began with the fundamentals:

1.	The primacy of teaching in the word of God, 
2.	The sovereignty of God in all theology and worship, and
3.	The examples of worship in the early church. 

From these basic principles they constructed a simple biblical way of worship to be applied in the church, for all time and over all the creation. these are the principle of Reformed worship we are studying in this course. 

## Foundational Principles 

### All Worship Is Based on Our Underlying Theology

Since the aim of salvation is to worship, we must not separate our thinking about worship from salvation. The theological principles of salvation and worship are linked. Our theology will determine how we worship. In simple terms, worship is applied theology. 

We can illustrate this below.
 
The more consistent our theology is with the Scripture, the more scriptural our understanding of salvation will be and the more consistent our principles of worship will be. As a result different theologies of God, man, salvation, and the church will lead to different theologies of salvation and worship and practice. 

1.	In the examples above we saw how the centrality of the Mass, the priest and the church controlled Roman Catholic theology. 
2.	In Arminian, man-centered theology, this placed man at the center of worship. mans need, his salvation become the basis for everything. What is helpful to me? What human methods can we use to help us make it easy and more acceptable so more men will come? To begin the discussion by focusing upon man reverses the theological pattern of scripture and denies basic theological principle that God is always at the center. Since man is a sinner, man does not know how to worship God. He does not know how to come into God presence. Due to man's sin, he will not come to God in an appropriate way. (See lesson 4.) Due to sin, the culture of this earth and the culture of heaven are vastly different. The world is man-centered; heaven is God-centered. The two theologies cannot co-exit, so worship based only upon what men want, rather than what God desires, is wrong. 

The principle that worship must be on God's terms, not man's terms does not deny man's need to be saved, nor our care for the lost, rather it reinforces the need for salvation.  An easy man-centered worship does not address man's deepest needs: his idolatry and captivity under sin, his need to listen to God, to repent and believe in Christ. Man-centered worship seeks to pull down the barriers between man and God, making it easy for him to enter the kingdom although Jesus, Himself, said it was hard due to man's sin (Matt. 19:24, Mark 10:25, Luke 18:25) and he needed to be born again (John 4) This form of worship denies the very truth of the gospel; man is a sinner and God must save him. 

We agree that we are never to put any additional human barriers before men. We must never create any obstacles that make it harder to be saved. In as far as we are able we are to be all things to all men, as Paul himself was, (1 Cor. 9: 22) and yet while Paul sought all means to evangelize, he expressly says he is under the law of Christ (1 Cor. 9: 21). He is still bound to honor God first. In this process we must never to deny God's Word. While To place men before God is an offense to God and deceives men as to what God is like. 

1.	Reformed-centered worship seeks to place God at the center. He is Lord he is sovereign, he calls and He saves and so He becomes the center of our thinking.  Man only enters into his presence according to his command and he must do so in the way that God commands. In reformed thinking the centrality of the word and the sovereignty of God plan the key role. 

2.	Many evangelical churches stress the equality and unity of the body.  They tend not to stress the leadership of the church officers (the elders and deacons) rather; all the congregation is encouraged to participate. They speak of sharing the Word, and women and children play a greater role in worship. Generally, the worship is horizontal, informal and tends to lack structure. In contrast Reformed theology is linked to representative leadership, that the congregation are lead in worship by leaders who bring them into to very presence of God. 

### The True focus of salvation is to Worship God

There are many benefits to man in salvation, but the Scriptues teach that all those benefits should lead to us worshiping God. When Israel is delivered from Egypt they are to go into the wilderness for three days, in order that they might worship God (Exod. 3:18, 24:1). In the book of revelation all those standing around the throne worship God (Rev 5:XX).  This basic principle frames our attitude to worship. Worship is about God first and us second. The church is called out of the wicked sinful fallen world that surrounds her in order to worship God. She is not to accommodate and bring the wicked world into her worship. True Worship is the church separating herself from the world in order to enter into God's presence. The church is not to mimic the world in worship; the church is to listen to God in worship. The desire for a church to become seeker sensitive has as its primary principle the need to make itself like the world in order to accommodate itself to the world.

In every aspect of our life we are to put God first. God is not here to serve man, rather God created and saved man in order that he mightily do His will. As Jesus clearly tells is. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. (Matt 6:33) In this verse Jesus is speaking in the context of prayer, but this will equally apply to preaching and teaching.. We see the same order in the Lord's prayer. When Jesus teaches his disciples to pray the opening petitions are all God focused, and only afterwards does it focus on man's needs. Jesus said; 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. 10 Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. 11 Give us this day our daily bread, (Math 6:10,11).

In many circles in the focus of worship is man centered. In the preaching and in prayers of the church, men cry out to God for what he can do for them, what they can get from God first, so making men the master and God the servant. It is particularly evident in health wealth and prosperity churches, in which men are encouraged to serve god for what he will give us now in this life. While God does care for us and provide but we are not to self-focused but God focused. 

The focus of  worship is not the salvation of men, unbelievers, rather, the main focus is for God's people to enter into God's house in the way he has told us in order for us to learn about him and to and to thank Him for His salvation. It is not that we do not want men to be saved, we do, but we are to remember that the church is mainly to be about the worship of God by his own church, and the blessing of those who have been saved. This is the scriptural focus. Most of the examples of corporate worship in the scripture are of God's people praising him. The worship service is the meeting of the Redeemed to worship their God in thanksgiving and praise. The object of worship is not man, his needs and desires, his fulfillment or even his salvation. 

### Trinitarian Worship 

God's work in Christ is the center of all our theology. In John 4, Jesus teaches it is to worship of the Father, through the Son by the Spirit. Jesus is the Truth of God. Worship must be the power of the Spirit. In worship we worship the Father. Our worship is based on Trinitarian principles, in which each person has a unique role. We worship the Father, though the son, through his mediation and by the assistance of the Spirit. Anything less is not true worship. 

## Definition of Worship

We conclude by defining worship. Jesus says we are to worship and serve God alone (Matt 4:10). Rayburn notes 'worship is a contraction of the original Anglo-Saxon word worth-ship' It means 'to accord Him the proper recognition of His inheritance, dignity and value, or to put it another way, to accord Him His worth or His worthiness (23). The word 'serve' has the original idea of serving as a slave for a master (see Acts 7:42, 24:14, Phil. 3:3, Heb. 10:2). To serve God is to offer oneself up to God in service even as Christ did in the temptation in Matthew 4. 

In the Old Testament to 'worship' included the idea of to bowing down and prostrating oneself, a posture indicating reverence and homage given to a lord (whether human or divine). In the New Testament the word for worship includes 'bow down' and it also includes service or piety.  In the New Testament it is often linked to praise and thanksgiving to the glory of God.  Worship in the New Testament usually means expression of praise or thanksgiving (Luke 17:15'16)  which is the appropriate human response to the magnificent glory of God. 

## Conclusion

There is a great deal of confusion about worship and yet worship is the heart of salvation and Christianity. We are saved to worship and that worship must be according to God's will, not our will.  Each member of the Trinity is vital for worship. It is the duty of all Christians to understand the nature of worship and for ministers to lead and teach it to their congregations.
