# Week 7: The Three Spheres of Worship Part 2

## Review

Last week we began to look at the three spheres of worship. We _almost_ made it through the first, individual worship. This week we will pick up where we left off and look at the other two spheres: family worship and corporate worship.

### Biblical and Systematic Theology

We talked some about how these tools work together to help us understand the Bible. They are sometimes pitted against each other, but because they guide **interpretation** and **application**, they are really unavoidable.

As we move into Systematics, it's important to note that the way we **systematize** our doctrine isn't necessarily authoritative. Wise Christians have gone before us and provided us with tools for organizing and understanding the Bible to address controversies and questions throughout history. The systems that bear fruit tend to stand the test of time, and wise Christians would do well to study these systems to avoid past errors.

Some systematics **are** a matter of orthodoxy. The Trinity is an example.

Others are not. The models we're using this term are not authoritative. I've selected them because I think they are helpful for thinking through worship in Bethel's highly particular context.

A key phrase we'll consider in later weeks is **good and necessary inference**, which is central to the Regulative Principle of Worship. Some inference is truly good and necessary; some inference not so much. The weaker the inference, the more charity we must exercise when formulating our doctrine.

## The Three Spheres, Continued

### Individual Worship

Jesus models this kind of worship for us, and often assumes it in his teaching. When we map it onto our two models, it helps us understand its strengths and weaknesses:

1. **Evangelism**: Individual worship is about us evangelizing ourselves, renewing our conviction that we are dependent on God, and renewing our longing for His Kingdom.
2. **Education**: Individual worship almost always includes some form of Bible study. It is important: even 15 minutes per day is longer than a weekly sermon.
3. **Experience**: Individual worship is an important component of deepening our relationship and reliance on God.
4. **Exaltation**: Worship is assuming a posture of prostration before God. By reading and meditating on His word and approaching him in prayer, we assume a posture that naturally exalts him.

We can also consider how individual worship renews our covenant with God:

1. **God initiates**: God's Spirit dwelling within us should compel us to some form of regular worship.
2. **God separates**: Psalm 51 models for us what individual confession looks like. Sanctification is also an important part of the individual Christian walk.
3. **God Speaks**: Bible study and prayer are both vehicles for God speaking to us.
4. **Signs and Seals**: There are no New Covenant sacraments instituted by and for individuals. 
5. **Provision for Future**: Again, it's hard to find a connection
6.  between **benediction**, or **sending**, and individual worship. The perseverance of the saints, and perhaps the abiding presence of The Spirit, give us a start. 

### Family Worship

This is worship that happens as a gathered family. Many of us do this once a day; the Puritans and many church traditions call for it at least twice a day.

1. God's commands and covenants happen in the context of family. Even after Israel is a nation and has the Levitical rights, upon entering the Promised Land, Joshua assumes the basic unit of faithfulness is the family (Joshua 24:15).
2. Job confessed on behalf of his children (Job 1:5).
3. Faithfulness for Abraham meant instructing his household (Genesis 18:18-19). Deuteronomy 6 highlights the importance of family instruction.
4. Circumcision happens within the boundaries of the family. Though Baptism changes and is administered by the church, in Acts it still often happens happens by household.
5. Jeremiah 31, the only explicit reference to the New Covenant in the OT, is full of family language. God's promises in the OT are generational.
6. The notion of traditional, genetic family is challenged in the NT. Luke 14:26 says "If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple." Jesus teaches that we will not be married in heaven. But family is still one of the primary metaphors Paul uses for the life of the church. Family thus becomes a **shadow** of the New Heavens and Earth.

How does family worship fit into our models?

1. **Evangelism**: Family worship is one of the primary ways that we shepherd our children and spouses shepherd one another. Our tables are important vehicles for evangelizing our neighbors as well.
2. **Education**: Family worship is a necessary companion to weekly sermons and Sunday School.
3. **Experience**: Children get to see their parents model intimacy and reliance upon God in a unique way in family worship.
4. **Exaltation**: Singing and prayer both happen in family worship and certainly exalt God.

We can also consider how individual worship renews our covenant with God:

1. **God initiates**: Through the parents, children are called to the worship of God.
2. **God separates**: Corporate confession occurs in family worship. We should confess on behalf of our children and model how they may do so privately. Job's example is instructive here.
3. **God Speaks**: Bible study and prayer are both vehicles for God speaking to us.
4. **Signs and Seals**: Again, no NT sacraments are administered by families. We do, however, recognize the household as an important component of baptism. Parents may appeal to their children's baptism during instruction and worship.
5. **Provision for Future**: It's worth considering that family worship in the morning provides parents an opportunity to bless and commission their children. They do not do so with the authority of the Church, but they may do so with some level of authority.

The regularity and intimacy of family worship is an excellent complement to corporate worship. It's incapable of the fullest expression of corporate worship, but fatherhood (and by extension, motherhood) and priesthood (interceding on behalf of our children) may be modeled in the home through worship.

### Corporate Worship

We will study corporate worship for the rest of the term. This week, we'll just consider a few highlights:

1. There are few explicit NT commands to worship weekly. Hebrews 10:25 is the most direct.
2. Like individual worship, corporate worship is **assumed** when it is taught. The church in Acts met daily, 1 Corinthians 11 and 14 both begin with "When you come together."
3. Hebrews 12:22 also gives us the most direct description of an actual worship service â€” corporate worship pictures for us the fulfillment of a great deal of OT imagery.
4. The first century church **added** to preexisting worship practices rather than replacing them. They went to synagogue on Saturday, and on Sunday they practiced Lord's Day meetings. The Lord's Supper was added. Agape Feasts were added to community life and included prayer.
5. Corporate worship is the kind of worship that happens in heaven. A good picture of this is Revelation 19.

Mapping corporate worship to our model will also occur in future weeks. What we will focus on this week is that corporate worship is the form most like worship in the Consummation of the Age, and we should give it proper place and emphasis.

1. Evangelism, education, experience, and exaltation all find their fullest expression in corporate worship.
2. God covenants with a people. Renewal and remembrance of this covenant works best when his people are assembled and do it together. The sacraments in particular are only administered in this corporate context.

## Discussion

1. How do these spheres overlap and reinforce one another?
2. Which sphere is most important?
3. Which spheres will be present in the New Creation, and in what ways might they change?
4. How can Bethel support families and individuals in worship?
