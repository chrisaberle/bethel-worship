## Purpose

> By the grace of God, Bethel exists as a church for Lake Charles and its surrounding communities where God’s worship and Word defines us, His Spirit changes us, and the Gospel of Jesus compels us.

We're starting in on a series that unpacks some key sections of Bethel's mission statement. The first thing we'll be covering is **"God's worship ... defines us."**

Mission statements serve a few important purposes in modern churches. Every church, as a part of the Body of Christ, shares in the same ultimate vision for the future. Bethel has talked a lot about this ultimate vision the last few years at Bethel. But as a part of the Body, we also have a particular mission, or part we play in that vision. A foot and a hand and an eye will all have different particular missions.

A mission statement is helpful because it gives us a starting point for understanding how Bethel fits into the Body of Christ. We are a particular group of people at a particular time and a particular place, called to particular work.

Over the next term, we'll consider worship: why we worship, how we worship, and how it fits into our mission here at Bethel.

## Topics Covered

### [Introduction: Why do we worship? What is worship?](1.md)

[Worksheet](1 Handout.md)

We look at these closely related questions in some detail. We cover common answers to these questions and their strengths and weaknesses. We'll settle on answers to both, and use those answers to frame the rest of the term.

### [A Biblical Theology of Worship](2.md)

[Worksheet](2 Handout.md)

We look at worship and related ideas as they occur in the story of Scripture. More than a word study, we'll trace the theme of worship and how it shapes our understanding of creation, the fall, God's promises, and their fulfillment in Jesus.

### The Lord's Day

This is a powerful and often under-appreciated theme in the Bible. From Genesis 1 through to Revelation God uses rest and Eden imagery as a consistent theme. We'll explore this theme, as well as the switch from Saturday to Sunday that occurred in the first century.

### Levitical and Temple Worship Patterns

We cover the sacrifices outlined in Leviticus 1-9, how they connect to temple and synagogue worship, and how the New Testament teaches us to think about them today. We also cover some of the conversation between the Reformed tradition and Anglican and Lutheran traditions regarding temple worship in the New Covenant.

### The Three Spheres of Worship

It's possible to think of worship three ways — individual worship, family worship, and corporate worship. This term focuses on corporate worship because of it's connection to our mission statement, but we touch on all three spheres and some of the relevant Biblical texts for each.

### The Regulative Principle of Worship

One of the major contributions of the Reformation period to worship was the development of the Regulative Principle. Even though it's a well-recognized term, how to define and apply it is a matter of difference in Reformed churches. We cover these issues and where to place Bethel in the discussion.

### The Elements of Worship

The Regulative Principle distinguishes between Elements, Form, and Context in worship, and regulates mostly the Elements. We discuss the Elements described in Reformed confessional tradition.

### The Sacraments and Worship

We cover the sacraments and their place in corporate worship services. We especially consider the Eucharist: how it is prefigured in the Old Covenants, it's place in corporate worship in the New Covenant, and it's place in the New Heavens and Earth.

### The Church Calendar

An overview of the Church Calendar, its origins, and arguments for and against its use. Also an overview of Israel's calendar and Paul's teaching on its continued observance.

###  Bethel's Liturgy

With a _thorough_ backgrounding in worship, we turn to Bethel's liturgy. Piece by piece, we'll look at each element of our worship service and discuss it in light of what we've learned in previous weeks.
