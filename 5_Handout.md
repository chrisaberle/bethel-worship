# 5: Sabbath & The Lord's Day Week 2

## Review

Last week we traced the themes of **seven** and **sabbath** in the pre-Exodus period.

1. **Seven**, the number of completeness, is used as a literary device throughout the Bible, especially the first few chapters. It has the same letters (שבע) as the word _complete_ and is often punned with the word _shabbat_ (rest / oath).
2. The **rest** of the Garden comes from God's completed work. Mankind was the last work of God and _rested_ into the Garden and a neverending Sabbath.
3. Two characteristics of this rest are **peace** and **plenty**.
4. The Fall disrupted the right relationships in God's good creation. This resulted in **enmity** and **scarcity**.

How are **curse** and **blessing** used in Genesis?

<br />

Why does God tell Israel to practice Sabbath?

<br />
<br />

## Sabbath Laws

### Manna

What does manna have to do with Sabbath laws? What does manna represent?

### Sabbath and Release

Who is supposed to rest on Sabbath? Why is this significant?

<br />
<br />

### The Year of Release

What is added to the Sabbath Year practiced every seven years? How is this a picture of Eden?

<br />
<br />

### Jubilee

What is added to the Jubilee Celebration?

<br />
<br />

It's unclear whether Israel faithfully followed _Shmita_ and Jubilee. In our Western context, we see remnants of these doctrines. Which aspects of our economy mirror _Shmita_? How would our economy be different if we applied these laws strictly?

<br />
<br />

### Entering the Land

How are the Promised Land and Rest connected?

<br />
<br />

## The Lord of the Sabbath

List some of the ways Jesus uses Sabbath in his earthly ministry.

<br />
<br />

## New Testament Teaching

Why might one still wish to practice Sabbath in the New Covenant?

<br />
<br />

How do the sacraments of baptism and the Eucharist connect to **rest**? How about the themes of **peace** and **plenty**?

<br />
<br />

Do we still live in a world of scarcity? How should we live as people who believe in God's abundance? Consider Acts and 2 Corinthians for ideas.
