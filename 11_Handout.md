# 11: Levitical Sacrificial Forms

## Abrogation or Fulfillment?

How are the Levitical sacrifices related to the themes of Temple and Sabbath we've covered so far this term?

<br />
<br />

Why did God give us Leviticus? How are sacrifices still relevant today?

<br />
<br />

Why are the sacrifices sometimes ignored in contemporary worship?

<br />
<br />

We've studied **elements**, **forms**, and **circumstances**. Where do you think the sacrifices fall, and why?

<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

## The Order of Worship

How are the sacrifices helpful for us? What happens if we ignore them?

<br />
<br />

How do the sacrifices correspond with our Covenant Renewal pattern from the beginning of the term?

1. God calls us to worship
2. God consecrates us through confession
3. God prepares and transforms us through His Word
4. God fellowships with us at HIs table
5. God sends us into the world as new creations

## Thoughts for This Week

1. How can we reflect this pattern in our daily walks with God and our families?
2. What might be the consequences of worshipping with unconfessed sin? Why should we leave our sacrifices at the altar and be reconciled to our brother?
3. Does the word cut you? Does it cut your children? Do your Bible readings prepare you for His presence?
4. Do you feel this progression in Sunday worship? How might you prepare yourself and your family to fully engage in each component?
