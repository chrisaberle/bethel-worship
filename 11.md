# 11: Levitical Sacrificial Forms

## Review

After several weeks of talking about various principles that guide our worship decisions, we settled in on three **elements** that we believe should always be included in worship:

1. God's word to us (public reading of Scripture, preaching)
2. Our response to God (prayer, vows and confessions, offerings)
3. Sacraments (especially The Eucharist)

When we start to design a worship service that includes these elements, more questions immediately arise that have to do with _how_ we do them: 

1. What should come first, the Scripture Reading or the sermon? How much should we read? Should the readings relate to the sermon? Should we read through the Bible, or a little bit of OT and NT every week? Should be follow the lectionary?
2. Should we pray extemporaneously, or write down our prayers beforehand, or only pray prayers given to us in Scripture? Should we pass around offering trays? What style of singing should we use?

We could of course go on.

Traditionally, these questions fall into the categories of the **form** and **circumstances** of worship. In general, many of the questions that remain are up to our best judgment, and we should use the Bible to shape and guide or judgment wherever we can.

Last week, we looked at synagogue worship and how it influenced the early church. Synagogue worship was developed by Jews without a Temple, and so it was well suited to Christians who saw Temple worship as fulfilled in Jesus. We also talked about Communion, the big Christian innovation, and how critical meals were to the church in its first centuries.

## Takeaways

This week, we'll be looking at the Levitical sacrifices in more detail. _Animal_ sacrifice is now obsolete, but sacrifices are still very important to the NT authors. We are Living Sacrifices that serve the Once and for All Sacrifice Jesus Christ. What God taught the Israelites helps us understand what our sacrificial worship should look like. 

We will see that **consecration**, **ascension**, and **fellowship** are the three categories of sacrifice. Their order matters, and they help us to understand the nature of Christ's atoning work on our behalf. We can reflect this reality in the way we do worship.

## Abrogation or Fulfillment?

Several weeks ago, we looked at the Biblical themes of Temple and Sabbath. We can frame the story of the Bible as God working in history to dwell again with his people after our fellowship was broken in Eden. 

The Levitical sacrifices, which we haven't covered in detail, play a critical role in both of these themes. The sacrifices provided a way for Israel to approach God again. They are also paired with the festal calendar in the literary structure of Leviticus. We have examples of sacrifice outside of the Tabernacle and Temple as well, frequently connected with Eden imagery. Sacrifice goes hand-in-hand with meeting with God.

This is an important hermaneutical point. A lot of Reformed thinking focuses on **abrogration** of Temple sacrifies in the New Covenant. This is why, for instance, Reformed thinking has tended to focus on synagogue worship over Temple worship to determine the **elements** we've covered in previous weeks. Because Temple worship is no longer required in the New Covenant, and because Jesus' sacrifice was once-for-all, many Reformed thinkers have excluded Leviticus in their formulations of worship.

I think an important question here is "Why did God give us Leviticus?"

This is a topic of some depth, and we don't have time to cover it completely. But we have the building blocks we need to prove that we should indeed pay attention to Leviticus when we consider how we worship God today:

1. The Temple is not obsolete. We know that the Temple foreshadowed Jesus, who is the true Temple. And we also know that on Pentecost, God established _His people_ as his new Temple. 
2. Likewise, Jesus is the True Sacrifice, but His people are also called to be living sacrifies. The NT is full of sacrificial language. The OT sacrifices are not abrogated; they are fulfilled in us. We can look to the OT sacrifices to better understand Christ's work for us, and our work in worship and life.
3. Being living sacrifices is our "reasonable worship" according to Romans. This Greek word is where we get our word **liturgy**. Jesus is the High Priest, but we are priests too. Priests do work in God's Temple, protecting its holiness by sanctifying the people who enter God's presence.
4. The language of shadow is important. Jesus is the Lamb of God, but without shadows his sacrifice is flat and two dimensional.

While Temple worship is no longer commanded and doesn't constitute the **elements** of worship, it is still wise to look to the Levitical sacrifices as **forms** that order and shape how we enter God's presence every Sunday.

## Three Categories of Sacrifice

We could frankly spend a whole term on Leviticus. There are five sacrifices described there, and each is a way of saying something to God:

1. **Purification Offering, Restitution Offering, Ascension Offering:** These all say "I'm sorry" to God and provide forgiveness of sin.
2. **Grain Offering, Fellowship Offering:** These say "Thank you" to God by giving back part of what God has given to us.

What is interesting about these sacrifices is that they all go through the same basic process when they are offered. The differences in the sacrifices aren't ones of substance, but rather emphasis.

When we look at the process, we see three basic stages, always in the same order:

1. **Purification** emphasizes the death of the animal and the spreading of the blood on the altar. It focuses on the blood, the "life" of the animal, "covering" the the sins of the people and purifying them. This corresponds to **confession**.
2. **Ascension ** emphasises the animal being cut up, washed, and burned on the altar. It is prepared to enter God's presence, and being transformed by fire, ascends to meet with God. This corresponds to the **Word**, which is a two-edged sword that rightly divides us and places us directly into God's presence.
3. **Fellowship** emphasizes a meal and communion with God. Priests, and often the people offering the sacrifices, ate portions of the sacrifice in a meal with God. This corresponds with **communion**.

We've talked about the regressive, repeating nature of covenants and holy space in past weeks. There is a three-fold pattern that describes increasing degrees of holiness as we approach God, and these sacrifices also fit that pattern. 

We might point out here that each of the three sacrifices correspond to areas of the altar (base, sides, top). It's also interesting to note that the contents of the Ark (Aaron's Rod, the Decalogue, the Manna) correspond neatly with this pattern. The progression is clear: we are cleansed by blood, transformed by Word, and once we have ascended we enjoy fellowship with God.

## The Order of Worship

We all inherently understand this pattern, but it's important to realize that we have inherited this understanding and we should not take it for granted. God instructed His people in how to approach Him, and thousands of years of practicing this pattern have made the order something of a foregone conclusion for us.

If you look at many worship services, however, it's evident that these lessons are increasingly forgotten. Many services omit confession, deemphasize Word in favor of performances, and introduce other innovations contrary to the pattern we've described. Over time, as worship shapes a congregation, this can create a lopsided understanding of Christ's atoning work.

Retaining this basic pattern in our worship reminds us of God's completed work for us, the nature of our relationship to Him, and the ministry of reconciliation we have in the world. Conveniently, we find that it maps very cleanly onto the order we've talked about the whole term:

1. God calls us to worship
2. God consecrates us through confession
3. God prepares and transforms us through His Word
4. God fellowships with us at HIs table
5. God sends us into the world as new creations

## Thoughts for This Week

1. How can we reflect this pattern in our daily walks with God and our families?
2. What might be the consequences of worshipping with unconfessed sin? Why should we leave our sacrifices at the altar and be reconciled to our brother?
3. Does the word cut you? Does it cut your children? Do your Bible readings prepare you for His presence?
4. Do you feel this progression in Sunday worship? How might you prepare yourself and your family to fully engage in each component?
