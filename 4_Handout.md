# 4: Sabbath and The Lord's Day

## Review

Last week we talked about temple and traced its development in the Bible. It is possible to tell the whole biblical story using temple as a narrative:

1. Eden is a **temple**.
2. Noah, Abraham, Jacob and Moses all meet God on **mountains**.
3. **Solomon's** **Temple** replaces the tabernacle and builds on the Eden imagery.
4. Nehemiah rebuilds the **Temple**, but its power and God's presence are diminished. 
5. God's presence returns in the person of Jesus. 
6. At **Pentecost**, God's presence indwells his people. 
7. In Revelation the **New Heavens and Earth** are depicted as a new Eden. 

## Creation

The fundamental pattern for Sabbath, like most biblical themes, begins on the first pages of the Bible. God teaches his people that the festivals they'll be commanded to celebrate are baked right into the creation order.

### Seasons
