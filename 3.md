## Review

Last week we covered a pattern for characterizing covenants.

1. God initiates, **taking hold** of something.
2. God **separates** and makes **something new**.
3. God **speaks**, stipulating the covenant.
4. God provides **signs** and **seals** of the covenant.
5. God arranges for the **future**.

We connected these categories to divisions in our own worship service: **Call to Worship**, the **Confession**, the reading of God's **Word** and the **sermon**, **The Lord's Supper**, and the **Benediction**. These are elements commonly found in many Biblical traditions, including Anglicanism and Lutheranism.

We also talked about Covenant as an important interpretive tool for us as we consider the transition from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant, particularly how God's very particular instructions for worship in the OT might apply to us today.

## Old and New

An important aspect of Covenant Theology that distinguishes it from Dispensationalism is the coherency between covenants. Rather than discrete agreements between God and a particular group of people, we see the OT covenants as a progressive revelation of God's plan to undo the curse and restore creation to the abundance and rest he created. God's covenants with man build upon one another, and they all prefigure Jesus. To see an example of this, let's turn to [Genesis 15](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/genesis/15.shtml).

>He said, “O Lord GOD, how may I know that I will possess it?” So He said to him, “Bring Me a three year old heifer, and a three year old female goat, and a three year old ram, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds. The birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.

>Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, terror and great darkness fell upon him. God said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years. “But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out with many possessions. “As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age. “Then in the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.”

>It came about when the sun had set, that it was very dark, and behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a flaming torch which passed between these pieces.

>On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,

>“To your descendants I have given this land,
    From the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates: the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite.”

This is one of the most famous passages of Scripture, a story that most of us have probably taught our children.

Let's focus on the animals. What is going on with the animals? For people like us who aren't familiar with Ancient Near Eastern culture, these animals may look like a kind of sacrifice. But this is actually a common practice in Ancient Near Eastern covenant making that has a deeper meaning: by splitting the animals in two, and walking between them, the covenant maker is saying "If I break my half of the covenant, may what happened to these animals also happen to me."

But does Abraham make this covenant?

No. He is in a deep sleep, and terror and darkness is upon him. Abraham is figuratively dead already. God's prophesies underscore this fact: I have made promises to you, but you will die, and your descendants will be enslaved and oppressed.

Then, a remarkable thing happens. While Abraham is dead in his sins, God walks the covenant curses alone. If this covenant is broken, God is the one who will be split in two. When in the Bible is God split in two? We celebrate God's faithfulness to _this_ covenant every Sunday at the Eucharist.

In Jesus, God has simultaneously upheld the covenants we cannot _and_ suffered the curses that come from breaking them. Imagine how this would read to an Ancient Near Eastern Hebrew surrounded by capricious pagan Gods who demand the blood of their own children.

Using thinking like this, we can often find deep and encouraging meaning even in the strange and bloody stories of the Old Testament. We will find similar encouragements when we study the Levitical sacrifices in a later week.

## Temple

We're now going to do a quick piece of Biblical Theology. One way of defining Biblical Theology is telling the whole story of the Bible as a story that leads to Jesus.

A great exercise for bible study is to take a theme or image that is common in the Bible, look for its seeds in Genesis, and then trace it's development through the OT and fulfillment in the NT. Today we're doing this with Temple.

Key texts:

1. Genesis 1-2
2. Exodus 25-31, Exodus 35-40
3. 1 Kings 6-9
4. Ezekiel 40-42
5. Revelation 21-22

### Eden As Temple

In the creation narrative, we find many clues that the whole of creation, and particularly Eden, was intended to look like a temple.

_Exercise:_ Draw a picture of the Garden, the Tabernacle, and the Temple.

1. Just as the temple was the place of God’s unique presence experienced by the priests, so Eden was the place where God walked with Adam ([Leviticus 26:12](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/leviticus/26.shtml)).
2. Adam is depicted as a priest with respect to his task, namely, “to work” (עָבְדָ֖) and “to keep” (שָׁמְרָֽ) the garden, which is the priest’s task in the temple.
3. The cherubim assumed Adam’s function to guard the tree of life, which became memorialized in the tabernacle.
4. The “tree of life” ([Gen. 2:9](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/genesis/2.shtml)) was probably a model of the lampstand in the tabernacle.
5. Israel’s tabernacle and temple had adornment that gave it a garden-like ambiance ([1 Kings 6](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/1_kings/6.shtml), 7).
6. Just as the entrance to Israel’s later temple was to face east and be on a mountain, and just as the end-time temple of Ezekiel ([Ezekiel 40](https://biblehub.com/p/nas/heb/ezekiel/40.shtml)) was to face east and be on a mountain, so the entrance to Eden faced east.
7. The ark, which contained the law, in the Holy of Holies echoed the tree of the knowledge of good and evil as both lead to wisdom.
8. As a river flowed out from Eden, so a river flows from the eschatological temple (Genesis 2, Revelation 22).
9. Just as gold and onyx are in the garden (Gen. 2:11–12), so they are used to decorate the later sanctuaries and priestly garments.
10. Just as the temple had a tripartite structure of concentric circles of holiness (Holy of Holies > Holy Place > Courtyard), so the garden of Eden had the same.
11. Just as the climax and purpose of creation was rest, so the construction of the tabernacle culminates with rest.

There are some themes we may highlight:

1. In Eden, God communed freely with Adam and Eve. The Fall disrupted this relationship. Redemption restores communion with God.
2. Adam and Eve are created in God's image and do his work. God creates and names; Adam names. God plants a garden, Adam expands that garden to fill the earth. The Fall ruins paradise and curses the world. Redemption restores this abundance.

### The New Covenant

We've connected Eden to the Tabernacle and Solomon's Temple, all the way through to the eschatological temples depicted in Ezekiel and Revelation. Right now, however, we're in the middle of this story.

_Exercise:_ Jesus is the new temple, and we, as his body, are the living stones that make up that temple. _We_ are the restoration of Eden until God remakes the Heavens and Earth. Write down how we presently fulfill each of the features above:

1. Where is God now present with His people?
2. Who are the priests now? Who is the High Priest?
3. What has happened to the Most Holy Place?
4. Where is the Tree of Life?
5. Where is the garden? Where is the water that comes from the throne and waters the earth?
6. Where is the law? Where may one seek wisdom?
7. How has rest changed?
