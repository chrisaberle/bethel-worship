# 10: Early Christian Liturgies

## Review

The last few weeks we've looked at the systematics of worship, and focused in particular on the task of building a worship service from scratch. We now have a model for sorting through the Biblical and historic examples that can guide us as we make decisions:

1. **The Regulative Principle of Worship**, which holds that we should only do things in worship if we have a Biblical justification for doing so. This applies to what we covered last week, the **elements** of worship: word, response, and sacrament.
2. **The Normative Principle of Worship**, which is more permissive and looks to model worship after **patterns** of worship we find in Scripture. This principle applies to the **Forms** of worship: the order, style, and manner in which we perform the elements. These forms are not commanded in Scripture, but there are still many patterns provided to us in the Bible that we can use to guide our decisions on this point.
3. **The Inventive Principle of Worship**, which holds that the Church is free to decide what to do in worship. We apply this principle to the **Circumstances** of worship: times, places, details like seating, &c. 

Part of what makes this exercise so difficult is that the New Testament is not very detailed when it comes to direction on worship. After talking about **The Elements** last week, we'll spend this week "checking our answers" by looking at some early church liturgies.

While early church liturgies are not authoritative, it's logical to assume that their proximity in time to Jesus and the Apostles makes them good examples for us. 

## Takeaway

This week we will see that early church liturgies were very simple and emphasized two aspects in particular: the **Sacraments** and **Fellowship**. There were reasons for these emphases that are relevant to us today. 

Given this emphasis, we should ask ourselves if we should have the same priorities today. Exclusive Psalmody is fun to talk about, but where (if anywhere) should we place the most emphasis? 

## The Earliest Liturgies

How did Christians worship in the years immediately after Jesus' earthly ministry?

For approximately the first 20 years of the Church, Christianity was a Jewish Messianic Sect, and Christians worshipped in Synagogue. As the number of Gentile converts increased, this practice necessarily changed: Gentiles were not always welcomed into Synagogues, and were certainly not welcome into the most exclusive rituals of Temple worship. 

Still, the roots of Christian worship were distinctly Jewish. Jesus worshipped in synagogue, and the disciples and apostles attended Temple frequently until its destruction in AD 70. Synagogue is distinct from Temple worship: it most likely developed during the Exile because Jews no longer had access to the temple.

Because synagogue patterns were rooted in the **decentralization of Temple**, it is a good starting place for Christians too. Centuries of Temple worship and imagery were translated into a more local, less formal context.

There is a great deal of study and debate on 1st century synagogue worship, but we're relatively confident in the following pattern:

1. Profession of faith
2. Prayer of eighteen blessings
3. Readings (Law, prophets)
4. Sermon
5. Priestly blessing

What is striking about synagogue worship is how **simple** it is. The sacrifices, rituals, and imagery have been replaced by things that all people can do in all places.

What **elements** of Christian worship are present here? Word and response are both present. In fact, so long as at least some of these prayers were sung — this is very likely, if not totally certain — this looks very much like our modern church services.

But what is missing?

## The Christian Innovation

Two practices were added as innovations by the early church:

1. The **Sacraments**, specifically the **Eucharist**.
2. The **Agape Meal**, which is not an element, but was a critical part of Christian fellowship in the first few centuries of Christianity.

This makes a lot of sense. Early Christians were Messianic Jews, and the sign of the New Covenant given by Jesus was a meal. They continued worshipping the same God, but this practice distinguished them from other Jewish sects.

The **Eucharist** and **Agape** were probably originally combined. At some point, they were separated. Within a few hundred years, as worship completely formalized, references to **Agape** pretty much disappear.

_Question:_ What was going on in the first few centuries that would have made table fellowship and communion particularly important to early Christians?

### The Didache

**The Lord's Teaching Through the Twelve Apostles** is a first-century anonymous document that gives one of the best pictures we have of the early church.  It is a very Jewish document and has many similarities to Matthew, but was probably not based on it. About a third of it is ethics, a third liturgy, and a third church polity.

The liturgy section of the Didache is primarily about communion. It is careful to point out that after the service, Communion was brought to people who couldn't attend: it was a primary mark of community. 

There are many possible reasons for emphasis on communion: synagogue is probably assumed, and The Eucharist is the main Christian innovation. But it is still notable that the early church, when they set out to write down apostolic teaching, spent so much time on Communion.

### Pliny the Younger

Pliny the Younger was a Roman administrator (~61-113 AD) who persecuted early Christians and wrote a letter to Emperor Trajan seeking his advice. Pliny had captured and tortured two deaconesses to learn more about the Christian sect. What he reports is interesting: on The Lord's Day, Christians met early in the morning for Communion, went to work, and later in the day reconvened for the **Agape**.

Even from the perspective of Rome, **The Eucharist** and **Agape** were distinguishing characteristics of Christianity.

### Justin Martyr's Liturgy

Justin Martyr (100-165 AD) is the other main source we have of the earliest Christian liturgies, and describes for us how things looked after Christianity split from the synagogue entirely. The service is similar:

1. Prayers of intercession
2. Readings (The Gospel, The Apostolic Writings)
3. Sermon
4. The Eucharist

We know at some point the Apostle's Creed was added to Christian practice, which brings this almost entirely in line with synagogue worship. Justin Martyr's liturgy comes into two pieces: **The Service of the Word**, and the **Eucharist**. Intercessory prayer happened after the Service of the Word, and included a Holy Kiss — a change that created a bridge between synagogue patterns and the Christian innovation of communion.

Again, we see an example of our takeaway this week: the early church seems largely disinterested in the details of liturgy as we normally think about it. A simple service of Word and prayer is held, followed by Communion.

## Takeaways

1. What do we have in common with the early church that might make communion and fellowship particularly important to us?
2. What is different?
3. How can we underscore this emphasis in our own families?
